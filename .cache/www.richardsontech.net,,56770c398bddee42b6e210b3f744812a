		<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>XP Sans Updates</strong></p>
<p>Windows XP fans out there &#8211; take note that those security updates from Microsoft will stop coming in April 2014, so&#8230; I know you love Windows XP&#8230; it really is time to look ahead and replace the old beast(s), bless their dusty souls, with something more secure.  There&#8217;s a lot to do between now and then, for the sake of your business.  Act now.</p>
<p>Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, they&#8217;re all better choices. Most calls I get for computer troubleshooting are about security intrusions (infections) on unpatched Windows XP computers.  So put replacement on your radar &#8211; if you&#8217;re a small business, implement that plan to replace your remaining XP machines.</p>
<p>April will be here really soon, and XP is going the way of Windows 98&#8230; it will run, but every month will be more vulnerable to being compromised.</p>
<p>Let the hackers have-at some other company&#8217;s information!</p>

		<p><strong>Encrypted email attachment</strong> that your anti virus software can&#8217;t scan!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the way it works:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You get a message that goes something like&#8230;<br />
You have received a secure message<br />
Read your secure message by opening the attachment, SecureMessage_4XX5V44YNOBBVXT.zip.<br />
The attached file contains the encrypted message that you have received.<br />
To decrypt the message use the following password &#8211;  SUgDu07dn<br />
To read the encrypted message, complete the following steps:  &#8230;blah blah blah</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like the old Doors song goes &#8220;&#8230;if you give this man a ride, sweet family will die&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall for this trap.  There is no secret, encrypted message for you.  There is a malicious program waiting for you to enter the password so it can to open up the doors to your computer, hook it up to some BOT_NET out there, steal any passwords that may be stored in your browser cache, offer to give you back &#8220;control&#8221; of your PC for a price, and rule over you from afar.<br />
=====<br />
Just delete it and have a great day.</p>

		<h3>Facebook login text only &#8211; why are you doing this to me?</h3>

<p>One day everything&#8217;s looking good and then suddenly you try to log into Facebook and all you see is the Facebook login text only page.  What happened?  And to confuse matters more, all your other web pages look fine.  ? ? ?</p>
<p>You may be seeing some sort of invalid certificate error when you try to log into Facebook as well.  ? ? ?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve Googled the issue and found the same things I did&#8230; clear out your cookies&#8230; delete all your cache files&#8230; ( hey, Facebook works on my mobile phone, and on my work computer&#8230; I&#8217;ll keep looking)&#8230;  but when you got to the solution where you&#8217;re supposed to rebuild your Windows profile, you say&#8230; Whoa!  That sounds complicated and like a pretty drastic step.  I&#8217;m going to see if I can find a simple solution to this Facebook login text only issue.  After all, it just started a couple days ago, and everything else is working when I log in.</p>
<p>All those other solutions you found&#8230; they&#8217;re valid&#8230; in certain conditions.  If the simple solution to this Facebook login text only problem doesn&#8217;t work, by all means, follow those other suggestions&#8230; they may fix your problem.</p>
<p>But in my case, it was just too simple&#8230; in fact, hidden like a garage sale million dollar painting!</p>
<p>Ready?  Drum-roll please&#8230;</p>
<p>Check your Time and Date control panel please.</p>
<p>If your Time and (especially) Date is off by too much, you&#8217;ll get invalid certificate warnings and Facebook will display a text only login page like the screen shot above.</p>
<p>Go ahead and try it.</p>
<p>If your time and date are correct, it only took you a minute to check and you don&#8217;t have to transfer any of your files back to your old profile and reinstall Office for the new login!</p>
<p>If this fixed your problem, we can be grateful it was easy&#8230; huh?</p>

		<p><strong>WordPress Hacked Again</strong> &#8211; ?</p>
<p>Today is Monday March 11, 2013</p>
<p>Late last week, I was getting ready to hit the sack but first decided to check a few things on this website.  There it was, before my eyes&#8230; my WordPress Hacked Again&#8230; every one of my pages!</p>
<p>Ugh!  I was looking forward to getting some sleep.</p>
<p>I decided to write this post to talk to other folks who use WordPress as the platform for their business website&#8230; community forum&#8230; personal blog&#8230;  WordPress is really great, right?  Easy to use, lots of templates, and themes, and plugins&#8230; and security holes too!</p>
<p>I thought having a strong password on my admin panel and backing up the database was enough&#8230;  I don&#8217;t know why anyone thinks my website such an interesting target.  I&#8217;ve had phishing scam hacks, and Arab Manifestos being read against a backdrop of quite pleasing sitar music&#8230; Has someone defaced your website too?  Don&#8217;t take it personally.  They don&#8217;t know who any of us are.  These aren&#8217;t the North Korean or Chinese hackers&#8230; Robin Hood&#8230; Julian Assange&#8230; or even Anonymous groups with a mission to expose corruption wherever it hides.  My guess is they&#8217;re sons and daughters, out having fun, making a mess, tee-peeing the equivalent of the tree in our front yard.  Great fun&#8230; that is until your ISP wants to charge you $50 bucks or more to help you rebuild your un-backed up website!</p>
<p>1.  Change the default administrator account for your WordPress Website to a more secure name.</p>
<p>2.  Set a strong password for the administrator account for your WordPress website.</p>
<p>3.  Install themes and plugins that get updated regularly!</p>
<p>4.  Install a good security plugin, like <strong><a href="http://www.wordfence.com/" target="_blank">WordFence</a></strong>, in your WordPress website.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are plenty of choices, so use Google or WordPress search feature to research other security packages out there.  Make sure to check how often the plugin gets updated!  The developer of WordFence is very involved and responds to user feedback pretty regularly.</p>
<p>5.  Backup your WordPress website at least once a month.  If you get hacked, and all that&#8217;s left of your hard work are explicatives or the words  &#8220;Hacked by somebody else&#8230;&#8221;, your web hosting company is likely to ask you the same question I&#8217;m asking your here:  &#8220;do you have a good backup of your site?&#8221;   Again, Google and WordPress are a good place to compare your choices for backup routines.  Many web hosts offer backups&#8230; check your CPanel.  Oh, and did I mention to only install plugins and themes that are updated often?  All these things are important to avoid being another WordPress Hacked Again site.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Tip:  After you backup your site, use an FTP client like FileZilla to download that backup file to your home PC or Mac, so you&#8217;ve got a local copy.  Also &#8211; really important &#8211; document what theme you activated when you created the backup.  You&#8217;ll need it if you ever need to do a restore of your site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be Proactive!  Defend your WordPress site!</p>

		<p>We don&#8217;t need no battery calibration&#8230; let&#8217;s just buy a new one!<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-521" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/HTC-Battery-Sm.gif" alt="Calibrate or recycle: how will I know if my battery is really dead?" width="141" height="141" /></p>
<p>&#8220;What if we could get people to buy new batteries for all their devices before they&#8217;re even close to dead?  Cha-Ching!&#8221;</p>
<p>We should care about battery calibration.  Hey, batteries get old and need to be replaced, right?  Let&#8217;s take a closer look, because that battery in my cell phone is not available at my local hardware store and it&#8217;s not 3 bucks!</p>
<p>Here are some simple ideas to get you started practicing battery calibration with all of your modern rechargeable devices.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a circuit in modern rechargeable batteries that tells the device how much capacity remains.  It <a href="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DellBattery.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-527" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DellBattery.jpg" alt="Batteries are different, Google your specific battery for best calibration tips" width="229" height="80" /></a>assumes I completely discharge the battery before plugging it in again.  If I only discharge the battery part way and then charge it up (like I do when my laptop is plugged into AC all day), then the circuit gets confused about where the top and bottom of the battery capacity &#8220;container&#8221; is.  There may be 35% capacity remaining, but the circuit thinks there&#8217;s only 5% and the device shuts down &#8211; well, in most cases, that circuit can be reset.</p>
<p>Each battery is a little different, so I&#8217;d encourage you to Google your cell phone&#8230; laptop&#8230; cordless drill&#8230; battery and use the term &#8220;calibration&#8221; in the search string.  Find an article that sounds just right?  Read the comments after each article to see what happened when people applied the practices the author recommends.</p>
<p>Essentially, what I&#8217;ve found is that periodically I need to completely charge up (100%) and then as nearly as I can, completely discharge without interruption, and then charge up the battery to 100% again.  Granted, technology is going to change and the two devices I use the most are my laptop and smart phone.  Both have Li Ion rechargeable batteries.  For the laptop, there are some Power settings that need to be changed in order to get a more complete discharge.  Here&#8217;s a video produced by atbatt.com describing how to configure a Battery Discharge power plan to use when you calibrate your battery.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-qX8qmHxnkhttp://" target="_blank">Create a Battery Discharge Power Plan in Windows 7</a><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.smalltech.battery.free&amp;hl=en" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-530" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/BatteryHD.jpg" alt="Battery HD by Smallte.ch" width="290" height="141" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started testing apps for my Droid smart phone that helps manage my battery usage and so far have found one that claims to recalibrate my phone battery without having to root the phone and enter a bunch of command lines.  I&#8217;m ok with command line work, but most people prefer a screen based interface.</p>
<p><a title="Link to Battery HD app in Google Play Store" href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=smallte.ch" target="_blank">Battery HD (for Droid Smart Phones)</a></p>
<p>There are tons of videos and articles out there, so if you can avoid spending $130 for a laptop battery for another year, is it worth a little research?</p>

<p><strong>Filtering Information For Us</strong></p>
<p>If you are an avid Facebook user, you may have noticed that a lot of messages from your friends are filtered.  You used to see posts from friends but they&#8217;ve sort of disappeared.  Filtering is a process where the information provider tries to predict what you are going to find most interesting and then delivers that content to you.  So if I have, for instance, many gay friends, then Facebook will send me sidebar ads that would be interesting to someone of that sexual orientation.  If I search for and click on links for gun rights articles, Rush Limbaugh, and Tea Party bloggers, Google is not going to offer me much in the realm of search results for the political left.  Maybe that&#8217;s ok, if I don&#8217;t want to know what people I don&#8217;t agree with think about and say.  Here&#8217;s a great article from WebProNews on the topic of  &#8216;filter bubbling&#8217;</p>
<p>http://www.webpronews.com/facebook-google-filter-bubble-2011-06</p>
<p><strong>Is Facebook filtering mail, or shaking us down for a buck? | The Question of Pay to Play</strong></p>
<p>Sometime in the recent past, Facebook created a secondary inbox for us&#8230; so we would not be bothered with all the posts from business pages we don&#8217;t interact with and people we don&#8217;t know.  It&#8217;s called &#8220;Other&#8221;.  This is interesting.  If you have a small business page, like many of my friends, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that there isn&#8217;t much interaction from the majority of followers.  You have a few who routinely comment, but wonder where all those other fans have gone.  If they don&#8217;t interact with your page on a regular basis, then Facebook considers them to be uninterested and filters your posts from even showing up in their news feed.  If you want to make sure they all get a really important post, like &#8220;Hey, where is everyone?&#8221; you can pay to &#8220;Promote&#8221; each post.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a form of filtering is also going on with friends you may want to connect with.  Let&#8217;s say you come across an old friend from the past who you are not connected with through any mutual friends.  You went your way, he went his&#8230; and now low and behold&#8230; there he is.  You could send him a friend request, but you don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;s followed the same life path as you&#8230; maybe you don&#8217;t want him getting a look over all your posts, and photos, and friends, etc.  So you decide to send him a message.</p>
<p>The fact that you are not connected to him in any way means that Facebook is going to filter your message as if it&#8217;s an advertisement from a complete stranger.  Let&#8217;s call it just this side of spam.  But, for $1.00, you can actually pay to have it delivered to his Inbox, where he&#8217;s sure to see it the next time he logs in.</p>
<div id="attachment_500" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://richardsontech.net/facebook-pay-to-play/sendtoinboxforabuck" rel="attachment wp-att-500"><img class="size-full wp-image-500" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SendToInboxForABuck.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Facebook paid message delivery offer" width="500" height="329" srcset="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SendToInboxForABuck-300x197.jpg 300w, http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/SendToInboxForABuck.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Facebook Pay to Play</p></div>
<p>A few thoughts come to mind as we contemplate what this means.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have things always been this way, or did Facebook just make this change?</li>
<li>After all, I don&#8217;t remember paying to get connected with people when I first signed up.</li>
<li>If I can pay a buck to deliver a message to a &#8220;strangers&#8217; &#8221; mailbox, then who&#8217;s stopping any company from doing the same?</li>
<li>Will I start to see advertisements filling up my Facebook Message Inbox?</li>
<li>Is there a way to change my preferences so I see more stuff in my regular Inbox?</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_501" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://richardsontech.net/facebook-pay-to-play/fb-filtering-prefs" rel="attachment wp-att-501"><img class="size-full wp-image-501" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FB-Filtering-Prefs.jpg" alt="Facebook Email Filtering Preferences" width="464" height="233" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Facebook Email Filtering Preferences</p></div>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t exactly the kind of preference setting I was thinking of:  deliver messages from PEOPLE to my inbox, deliver messages from ADVERTISERS to the Other box.  Facebook&#8217;s intention seems pretty clear these days:  your ability to tell is all about yourself is still free, but if you want to connect or communicate with others, be prepared to pay for it.</p>
<p>It seems the &#8220;people you may know&#8221; are the friends of friends, not the guy you knew a long time ago who may send you a message across Facebook to see how you&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>For those messages, we&#8217;ll just have to keep looking through our &#8220;Other&#8221; message box.</p>
<p>One last thought&#8230; check out this Fox Business piece about Pay to Play on Facebook, then ask yourself if you&#8217;re ok with Facebook holding all this personal intelligence on you and selling it to someone who&#8217;s willing to pay to contact you.</p>
<p>http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/2049911511001/facebooks-pay-to-play/</p>
<p>When is enough, enough?  I&#8217;m just asking&#8230;</p>

		<p>Now is the best time to log into and secure online accounts you have open across all the social and web based sites.  How many of us have opened accounts with web based services to accomplish one task and then never return&#8230; well, for a really long time&#8230; then one day you decide to go log into one of those ancient sites to see what information is out there on (sorry to pick on you) Friendster.  Yep, you still have that account out there.  But you&#8217;ve gone through one desktop and two laptop computers since you last logged in and you have no idea what the username and password are.  Hmmm</p>
<p>Well, you&#8217;re in luck!  They have a password reset option!  They&#8217;ll send you a password link to your (this happened to me last week) Comcast email account &#8211; because that was your primary account when you joined Friendster.  But you haven&#8217;t been a Comcast subscriber for over two years.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry&#8230; they&#8217;ve instituted Security Questions!  The problem is, you haven&#8217;t logged in for so long, you never set up the security questions.  Sounds pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>This is exactly why now is the time to log into and secure online accounts&#8230; at least the ones you use on a regular basis.  I&#8217;ll get to some strategies for getting back into those really old Blogger or Friendster accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my situation:  I set up a Blogger.com blog about 5 years ago using one of my domain names in front of  &#8220;blogger.com&#8221;.  Now I want to use that domain name for something completely different.  So I&#8217;d rather have those old blog posts disappear.  But Blogger was absorbed by Google, and my Google login is not associated with that old domainname.blogger.com account&#8230; only my Comcast email address.   I lost access to that email account when we moved into a rural area where Comcast has no service.  I can fix the situation by finding someone who still is a Comcast subscriber and convince them to add my old address (if it&#8217;s still available) to their account with a password I make up.  Then I can &#8220;log in&#8221; to my old email address and go back to Blogger.com and request a password reset.  Sound like a pain in the you-know-what?  Childsplay&#8230; check out Scenario 2</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re out playing an online game that&#8217;s supported by ads that run in the right side bar.  They aren&#8217;t too intrusive, and hey&#8230; you and everyone else gets to play for $0.00  But one evening just as you&#8217;re about to beat one of your best opponents, one of the ads delivered through the ad stream has some malicious code.  The malicious code delivers a pop out warning dialog right in the middle of the screen&#8230; right where you need to click on the game controls&#8230; you find the &#8220;X&#8221; in the upper right corner of the pop up and click it without loosing concentration on your game.  In the background, the malicious code executes itself and installs scripts that locate all passwords stored in your browser cache and immediately log into Yahoo, Google, MSN, and Facebook&#8230; copying all your contacts and sending them an email titled &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to see this video&#8221; with a link in the body that looks like a YouTube link, but which actually downloads the malicious scripts.  It doesn&#8217;t stop there&#8230; while logged into your online accounts, it automatically changes your password and sets up password security question/answer combinations (which were unset before).  It adds its own secondary email address as a backup, because the secondary email was not configured either.</p>
<p>You start getting chat messages from your friends on Facebook that say:  &#8220;WTF Dude!  You are sending me this virus crap  on Facebook and email.  Better clean up your profile.&#8221;  Shutting down your computer will fix nothing.  You need to get back into all the accounts and change your passwords, but the automated scripts have already changed them for you and locked you out.  Ever tried to call tech support for Google or Yahoo?  Yahoo is a lot easier to get ahold of.</p>
<p><strong>What to do &#8211; Securing Online Profile Login Accounts</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess&#8230; so this is why I say to you that now is the best time to log into and secure online accounts you have open across the web.   So, what do you need to do to secure your online accounts?  For the sake of this article, I&#8217;ll limit my recommendations to non-financial institution, or government, or work related accounts&#8230; I&#8217;ll speak only in terms of Web based accounts you may have opened for email, social networking, or other information search sites: (think Gmail, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>A Secondary Email Address</strong></p>
<p>When you go into the account settings on just about every account you have, there is a place for you to put your email address.  This is how the company will communicate with you.  There&#8217;s also a place for a secondary account&#8230; they&#8217;ve realized that sometimes we stop working for the company, or subscribing to the service (Comcast), close the primary email account, or get hacked.  So the secondary email is another way to confirm that it was really you that asked to change the password and security questions this evening.  Here&#8217;s a sample email I received from Yahoo!:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">New secret questions were added to your Yahoo! account ?(xyz******)?.<br />
To ensure that your account information remains accurate and secure we notify you whenever this information changes.<br />
This change request was made on January 20, 2013 at 12:01pm PST.<br />
If the changes described above are accurate, no further action is needed. If anything doesn&#8217;t look right, follow the link below to make changes:<br />
https://edit.yahoo.com/forgot?stage&#8230;</p>
<p>This message goes to both my primary and secondary email accounts, and hopefully the secondary has not been hacked too.  That link at the bottom allows me to cancel the change and restore the account to the way it was before.</p>
<p><strong> A Security Question/Answer Combination</strong></p>
<p>These sites also allow you to set up a security question that presumably only you know the answer to&#8230; this makes it a lot more convenient to just reset your password without having to go log into your email to validate that you are really who you say you are &#8211; You.  A word of advice.  Most of them include &#8220;Your Mother&#8217;s Maiden Name&#8221; &#8211; I would caution against picking this one.  Your bank asked you this when you opened your account and they use it as one of several personal questions to identify you.  Look for a question that isn&#8217;t so sensitive:  Your first car, The last high school you attended, Your favorite teacher&#8217;s name, Favorite movie, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a hard time remembering your password from one site to another.  You usually get three tries and then your account is locked out until the company opens up again Monday morning EST.  You try password 1, nope.  Oh yeah&#8230; now you remember.. now it&#8217;s: &#8220;xyz&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; Wrong Again.  Last try&#8230;</p>
<p>Stop here and click the link that says: &#8220;I forgot my password&#8221;.  It will take you to the screen that lets you choose between answering the security question you chose, or send you an email with a link to reset your password.  Now the choice is up to you.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s easy!</p>

		<h2>Visual Editor Missing WordPress</h2>
<p>All of a sudden, I found my visual editor is</p>
<div id="attachment_394" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://richardsontech.net/visual-editor-missing-wordpress/visual_editor_missing_wordpress" rel="attachment wp-att-394"><img class="size-medium wp-image-394 " title="When visual editor in WordPress is disabled" src="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/visual_editor_missing_wordpress-300x128.jpg" alt="visual editor missing wordpress - RichardsonTech.net" width="300" height="128" srcset="http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/visual_editor_missing_wordpress-300x128.jpg 300w, http://richardsontech.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/visual_editor_missing_wordpress.jpg 609w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When WordPress visual editor missing</p></div>
<p>missing in WordPress!  What happened to my WYSIWYG visual editor?  I updated to the latest version and my visual editor is still gone.  I&#8217;ve read through lots of WordPress forum posts that suggested an incompatible plugin, so I removed all my plugins&#8230; but my WYSIWYG editor is still missing in WordPress.  I&#8217;ve even gone back to the Twenty Eleven theme.  But the visual editor is still gone.  All I have this html text editor in WordPress!</p>
<p>I joined you in this quest after my WordPress site got hacked.  I restored my database and found my WYSIWYG editor was gone.  I read many articles on the WordPress forum about editing the php documents in wp_content, removing all the plugins, changing themes&#8230; but in my case, these detailed and complicated solutions did not restore the visual editor missing from my WordPress admin panel.</p>
<p>A very simple <strong>visual editor missing WordPress</strong> solution worked for me.  Try this before hitting all the hardcore solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pull down &#8220;Howdy <em>Username</em>&#8221; from upper right corner (where you log in and out)</li>
<li>Select &#8220;Edit My Profile&#8221;</li>
<li>Near the top, find the field called: &#8220;Visual Editor&#8221;</li>
<li>Check the box next to &#8220;Disable the visual editor when writing&#8221;</li>
<li>Click the Update Profile button at bottom of page</li>
<li>Go back to the top, now uncheck the same box &#8220;Disable the visual editor when writing&#8221;</li>
<li>Click the Update Profile button at bottom of page again</li>
<li>Go back to the page you were editing</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see the |Visual|Text| tabs?  If so, then your visual editor is enabled again.  The idea here is to turn the editor off and then on again.  Try the simple answer first&#8230;</p>

		<h3>Hey, where did this pop up come from&#8230;  who&#8217;s trying to <strong>control my PC</strong> ?</h3>
<p>This post, Control My PC, is really about a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being alert</li>
<li>Exercising wisdom</li>
<li>Keeping your computer up to date</li>
<li>Controlling your online experience</li>
</ul>
<h4>Control My PC</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s early Fall 2012 and a few days ago the technology company Mashable reposted an article about how Skype is being used as the latest platform to trick us into opening our doors to a computer worm called &#8220;Dorkbot.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s a link to the original TechNewsDaily article that Mashable reprinted, if you&#8217;d like to know a little more about how today&#8217;s social engineering ploy works.  It&#8217;s short and informative, and has really sound advice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/8209-skype-botnet-scam-windows.html?" target="_blank">Skype-Dorkbot Article<br />
</a></p>
<p>In the rest of this article, I&#8217;ll offer you a few steps to prepare yourself, and finally what to do in case you get infected by this or any other malicious software.  But first, some advice about stepping around the pothole filled with water in front of you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your friends are not going to send you a zipped attachment of their new profile photo, don&#8217;t open it!</li>
<li>Tomorrow, as you&#8217;re reading this, the new &#8220;Con&#8221; (confidence trick) will be about something else &#8211; we should always ask, &#8220;Really?&#8221; when presented with something to open or some link to follow.</li>
<li>Even if it looks like it came from me, or your Sister, Dad, BFF, or anyone else you know, does it look suspicious?</li>
<li>Con artists are always looking for new ways to separate us from our money.  Does it look like something your loved one would really send&#8230; without much of a description or personal note?</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestion:  print a copy of this whole page for yourself in case you get infected and can&#8217;t get to anything on your computer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><span style="color: #000080;">This article is my gift to you and your family.  My hope is that this will help you become wise as a serpent and arm you to defend yourself against the con artists out there trying open you up and steal your information.<br />
</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Preparing your defense now is easier and less expensive than cleaning up later.</strong></span></p>
<p>Steps to take ahead of time (that&#8217;s right now!)</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
<li>Learn how to boot your (Windows) computer into &#8220;Safe Mode&#8221;  (http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true)  [Tip:  Safe Mode with Networking will allow you to run Internet based virus scans even in Safe Mode]</li>
<li>Learn how to use System Restore to go back to the way things were running before you got infected:
<ul>
<li>Windows XP (support.microsoft.com/kb/306084)</li>
<li>Windows 7 and Vista Video (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/fixing-a-problem-using-system-restore)</li>
<li>Windows 7 and Vista written (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure your version of Windows has all security updates installed.  Windows Vista and 7 have a built in Windows Update utility that will check for updates.  With XP, you&#8217;ll need to use Internet Explorer to check for updates manually.
<ul>
<li>Windows XP (http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/)</li>
<li>Configure Windows XP to run Updates Automatically (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306525)</li>
<li>Windows Vista/7 (http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/Install-Windows-updates)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check your anti-virus software to see if it&#8217;s getting regular updates&#8230; is it updated now?
<ul>
<li>Know what anti-virus software is protecting your PC!</li>
<li>Look for a properties or status page in the program and look for &#8220;Virus Definitions&#8221; (that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s usually called)</li>
<li>Go online and see what reviews people are giving about your anti-virus software.  If they&#8217;re complaining about not being protected, then switch.</li>
<li>If you haven&#8217;t re-subscribed to the trial version of AV software that came with your computer, then you&#8217;re likely not being protected.  Those virus definitions have to be updated (usually daily).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anti-virus and anti-malware programs come in Free, Trial, and Subscription versions.  The people at <strong><a href="http://www.av-test.org/en/home/" target="_blank">AV Test</a></strong>(http://www.av-test.org/en/home/) publish regular reports on how well different anti-virus products perform in their independent test lab.
<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re going to use &#8220;Free,&#8221; then expect to spend more time making sure you&#8217;re protected and that the software is updating.  The free ones are either give-a-ways by larger companies with some of the advanced features disabled&#8230; so you&#8217;ll move to the Subscription version &#8211; which is helping to support their anti-virus research operation.</li>
<li>If you are using a Trial version (your PC probably came with one from McAfee or Norton), then you&#8217;ll have to subscribe at the end of the trial or the updates will stop coming in and yours is just the PC those con artists are looking for.  So be on guard for phishing scams!</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve found an anti-virus product you trust and feel will guard the doors of your PC, subscribing is how you support their development team.  As of the day I&#8217;m writing this note, here are some of the programs/groups that I&#8217;ve worked with and think are worth your consideration:
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank">Malwarebytes</a></strong> (http://www.malwarebytes.org/) &#8211; Free/Subscription</li>
<li><a href="http://www.avast.com/en-us/index" target="_blank"><strong>Avast </strong></a>(http://www.avast.com/en-us/index) &#8211; Free/Subscription</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.avira.com/en/index" target="_blank">Avira</a></strong> (http://www.avira.com/en/index) &#8211; Free/Trial/Subscription</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/" target="_blank">ESET Nod32</a></strong> (http://www.eset.com/us/) &#8211; Trial/Subscription</li>
<li><a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank"><strong>SuperAntiSpyware</strong></a> (http://www.superantispyware.com/) &#8211; Free/Subscription</li>
<li><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/personal/" target="_blank"><strong>Spybot Search and Destroy</strong></a> (http://www.safer-networking.org/personal/) &#8211; Free/Donations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you got down to the step where you were trying to figure out what antivirus program you have an you ran out of steam and went back out to check your Facebook account and that was a couple of months ago.  Now you think your computer has been taken over by some kind of toolbar that says you are really badly infected and you need to pay $79 to get the security check to clean up your computer.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t touched it already, don&#8217;t touch the pop up or toolbar or whatever it is you don&#8217;t recognize as your installed anti-virus software&#8230; take your hands off the keyboard and mouse&#8230; take a deep breath and ignore what you see on the screen for a minute&#8230;. this is the con artist presenting you with his pitch.  Don&#8217;t touch the window.</p>
<p><strong>The pop up is scaring me, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Work around the pop up screen (if you can) and close all the programs you were working on, except the browser.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you can close the active tab on the browser without touching the pop up alert, do so.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Exit the browser (if you can without touching the pop up window)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Shut down the computer (if you can), if the &#8220;security&#8221; software keeps interfering with you then just hold the power button down for 10-15 seconds.  If that doesn&#8217;t work, pull the power cord out of the back of the computer &#8211; last resort.</p>
<p><strong>I think I&#8217;m infected, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The first thing you should try is System Restore.  If this works, it&#8217;s the fastest way to get back to being uninfected.  But sometimes, the malicious software will disable System Restore or infect all of your recent restore points.  Well, that sucks!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So you did a system restore to a point before you got infected and the junk is still on your computer.  At your option, try to run system restore after each of the steps after ESET Online Scanner</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut down and boot into Safe Mode with Networking  (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/app_system_restore_hss_safemode.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank">Running System Restore in Safe Mode) &#8211; http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/app_system_restore_hss_safemode.mspx?mfr=true</a></li>
<li>Open your browser and Google &#8211; ESET Online Scanner: at the time of this writing, it&#8217;s at:  <strong><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a></strong></li>
<li>Run the scan and let it clean up whatever it finds</li>
<li>Run Malwarebytes (make sure to run the updates so you have the latest definitions) &#8211; do the complete scan</li>
<li>Run SuperAntiSpyware (&#8230;updates here too)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to change antivirus programs, make sure you remove the old one before installing a new antivirus program (you only want one Sheriff defending your PC at a time).</p>

		<h3>Update on LinkedIn mobile app notification issue</h3>
<p>Most of you probably have not stepped in this pot-hole, but in case you do, here is the situation and the fix.  LinkedIn has also advised me that they are including an update limit in an upcoming release of their mobile app.<br />
So, you comment on someone&#8217;s post that continues to receive activity weeks, months later.  In my case, it was an enticement to help prove a point that LinkedIn matters.  A very active post like this could live on for years&#8230;  So far, on my Droid, I&#8217;ve gotten over 1000 update notifications that Jeff Zelaya&#8217;s bet with his boss has received another comment.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the solution as of Wednesday morning, September 12, 2012&#8230; in a few days, this will likely change with a new update to the LinkedIn mobile app.<br />
1. Click the blue &#8220;in&#8221; icon in the upper left<br />
2. Click on the picture of &#8220;You&#8221;<br />
3. Click the gear icon in the upper right<br />
4. Uncheck the &#8220;Turn on notifications&#8221; box</p>
<p>You should know this will turn off all notifications.  Hopefully, the people on the mobile team and LinkedIn will roll out a more elegant solution in the coming days.  Once that happens, you&#8217;ll likely want to come back and re-enable notifications.</p>
<p>Final word (to the wise):  think twice before making a comment on someone&#8217;s post that you are not directly connected to on LinkedIn.</p>
