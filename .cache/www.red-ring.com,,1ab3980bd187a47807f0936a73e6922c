<h1>Learn how to end time tracking worries</h1>
<h2>"The easiest, fastest and most accurate time tracking software available!"</h2>
<br>
Dear Time Saver,<br>
<br>
I'm Richard Bergeron, lead developer of <span class="product_name">Time Is Money</span>. The easiest, fastest and most accurate time tracking software available.<br>
<br>
I will show you how to <span class="highlight">stop wasting money</span> by creating order from your time tracking chaos.<br>
<br>
I've spent years using this program daily. I know what you go through
and believe we have created the solution to easy and accurate time tracking. With this program,
I am able to keep track of all the projects I manage with very little effort. My time is money
- literally - since any time I spend not working is time I can't make money. Also, if I don't keep
accurate records of time spent on a project, I don't get paid the full amount due. That's why
using this program makes sense for me and will make sense for you, too.<br>
<br>
<div class="active">
Guys - your software seems to fit exactly what I am looking for. Good job and well done!
</div>
<br>
Don't take my word for it... Read more <A HREF="testimonials.php" target=_blank>testimonials</a>.<br>
<br>

<h1>Not just for consultants</h1>
If you are a consultant, lawyer, engineer,
web developer, or anyone else who must keep track of time billed to different
projects, <span class="highlight">you need <span class="product_name">Time Is Money</span></span>. You will keep highly accurate billing records by easily punching in and out
for each project. Reports summarize all billed project time in a given time
period and allow client billing using the simple invoicing feature.<BR>
<br>
<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px">Throw away your old paper timesheets</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:20px">and immediately become more productive!</h1>
<span class="product_name">Time Is Money</span> has an <span class="highlight">intuitive interface</span> that allows for a quick start. Entering timeslot information, categories or projects are quick and easy. You can even add a new project or category as you are punching in! It is great for Power Users and Beginners alike.<br>
<br>
There are two different views for two different perspectives on the data. There is the appointment-like view with a graphical display of how much time has been used and a list view for the number crunchers out there.<br>
<br>
<span class="highlight">You already know how to use it</span> - You've double clicked to select items all your life, well, at least ever since you've owned a computer. So you know how to create timeslots, print reports and select a different date. You know everything about how to use <span class="product_name">Time Is Money</span> and you haven't even downloaded it yet. Isn't that great?<br>
<br>
If you do not want to deal with our simple display, we have an option where you can minimize complexity down to a single button - for punching in and out.<br> 
<br>
It can even handle the little things for you such as backing up live data files while they are still in use by others.<br>
<BR>
<h2>
Ask yourself...</h2>
<h1 style="font-size:20px">
- Am I getting credit for all the hours I've worked on this project?<br>
- Do I know how much this project is costing me?<br>
</h1>
If you answered yes to both of these questions then just go on with your life - you don't need this program.
BUT, if you answered NO to EITHER question, you definitely need our program and should read on...<br>
<br>
I know it can help you -

						viverra mollis. Proin dapibus mi porttitor nisi. Donec eget nibh dictum magna iaculis pharetra.

						Sed quis urna. Duis tempor elit ac nulla. And don't you forget it.
