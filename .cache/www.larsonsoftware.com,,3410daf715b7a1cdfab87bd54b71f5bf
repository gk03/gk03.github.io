			<img src="images/keith.jpg" alt="" class="photo"><p class="title">Keith Larson - <em>President and Owner</em></p>
			<p class="firstline"><em>"I grew up in a small farming community in western Minnesota where I
			learned the value of a good reputation, honesty, hard work, and strong values."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Keith considers himself lucky to have been introduced to computer programming as a sophomore in high school.
			&nbsp;&nbsp;He attended college at Mankato State University and graduated in 1987 with a double major in 
			Computer Science and Business Finance, and a minor in Economics.&nbsp;&nbsp;He then spent the following 
			eight years working for various companies before striking out on his own.</p>
			<p>In 1995, Keith decided to start his own company.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"A friend of mine in the consulting business
			had a client where the consultant had made kind of a mess.  It was just a two week contract, but he really needed
			someone to straighten it out and push the project into production.&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to take it, and I never looked back.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			My education was exactly what I needed to start a small business, and my work experience had taught
			me valuable lessons about how to treat clients and employees."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Larson Software
			Development, Inc. has been in business for seventeen years now, and Keith feels that the company has
			something special to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>"We have some of the best people in the industry, both technically and personally.
			&nbsp;&nbsp;We treat our clients with respect, courtesy, and a genuine concern for their needs, and due to the high
			quality of our consultants, our clients feel they are receiving a greater value than they would get from our competition."</em></p>

			<img src="images/michelle.jpg" alt="" class="photo"><p class="title">J Michelle Taylor - <em>Corporate Relations Manager</em></p>
			<p class="firstline"><em>"After 18 years in the Mortgage Industry and being mostly self-employed, I had no idea of what I was getting myself into when I joined Larson Software in 2002.  What I discovered was that by maintaining Keith Larson’s values, we were able to build a company with a unique subset of technically excellent individuals, who are family-oriented and take a tremendous amount of pride in their work.  I have no regrets."</em></p>
			<p><em>"Being able to work one-on-one with clients and consultants is important to me.   It’s all about relationships.  I enjoy working with the people in this industry, because building and maintaining these relationships is where I thrive.  Throughout my association with Larson Software I haven’t come across another company that compares in respect to talent or integrity.  I can’t imagine working anywhere else."</em></p>
			<p><em>"Much of my free time is spent volunteering for a therapeutic horseback riding program for developmentally disabled adults and kids."</em></p>

			<img src="images/connie.jpg" alt="" class="photo"><p class="title">Connie Fritz - <em>Senior Consultant</em></p>
			<p class="firstline">Connie Fritz is a 12-year veteran of the IT industry. Her strong background working with large-scale enterprise systems, as well as with small companies, puts her at a ready for action advantage in the Retail, Law, Insurance and Financial arenas.</p>
			<p>Her ability to pick up and learn new technologies quickly makes her a valuable asset on any project.  Whether it's putting out fires, designing and developing a new application, or migrating a business to a new platform, she is always up to the task.</p>
			<p>In her free time Connie enjoys reading, hiking, traveling and zoning out in front of the TV eating cheesy puffs.</p>

	<h3>
		<a href="#">Vision</a>
	</h3>
	<div>
		<div id="vision">
			<p>Larson Software Development, Inc. grew out of a very simple premise: to provide our clients with a 
			different kind of consulting company, founded on the basis of exceeding client expectations, integrity 
			of character and old-fashioned hard work.  Our reputation is the result of that vision and an undisputed 
			commitment to excellence.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1995, we’ve built our reputation on our original vision, 
			along with attitude, flexibility and individuality.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are extremely proud of our accomplishments.</p>
			<p>As we enjoy the reputation of being the best consultants in our market, we are committed to remain focused 
			on the strategy that has propelled us to where we are today.</p>
			<p>We have chosen to remain compact and elite, and don't believe that excellence can be achieved or maintained 
			by attempting to be "all things to all people".&nbsp;&nbsp;We stick to what we know best.... design and 
			development of applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>As we face the challenges of the future, we remain committed to providing our clients with the highest
			level of service and quality available within the Information Technology industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
			the technology has never stopped changing, the original quality that we continually provide to our
			clients, will never change.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h3>
		<a href="#">Approach</a>
	</h3>
	<div>
		<div id="approach">
			<p>Our highly successful track record demonstrates our ability to understand your business and
			seamlessly integrate with your project team.&nbsp;&nbsp;As our client, you have access to more
			knowledge through our individual and accumulated experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we have a strong
			sense of integrity, pride and ownership in our work, we bring a winning perspective to every job
			and can help you achieve better results, even on your toughest challenges.</p>
			<p>We promise only what we believe we can deliver and deliver on every promise we make.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			You can always count on Larson Software Development to respond to your business needs with a
			straightforward and honest approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using industry standard methodologies, we
			effectively plan, estimate and propose resources based on your objectives and budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			Quality is never compromised.</p>
			<p>In doing business, our goal is to develop long-term relationships with our clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			We start by developing a clear understanding of the clients’ current and future needs along with
			their available existing resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;We then provide solutions based on sound technology,
			performance requirements and established industry standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Larson Software Development embraces a hybrid of development methodologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have
			found that a traditional software development methodology is too rigid and doesn't fit well into
			the fast-paced, ever-changing world of web development.</p>
			<p>Quite often the design phase uncovers requirements that are technically unfeasible or possibly
			too expensive to implement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Business requirements and priorities are also prone to
			change during the development cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just some of the reasons why it is
			impractical to follow a strict waterfall approach of requirement analysis, system design,
			development and testing cycle.</p>
			<p>We therefore find it much more practical, efficient and beneficial to everyone to follow a model
			where requirements gathering and analysis is continued until a critical mass has been reached.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			At that point, the analysis, design, development, and test phases are compressed into
			a series of short, iterative development cycles.</p>
			<p>This approach has a number of distinct advantages over the traditional waterfall development
			model.&nbsp;&nbsp;Iteration allows for effectiveness and self-correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies
			have shown that human beings rarely perform a complex task correctly the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
			However, they are extremely good at making an adequate beginning and then making many small
			refinements and improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore much better to use this to your
			advantage rather than fight it.</p>
			<p>Each iteration of the development cycle delivers a well-engineered, functional portion of the
			final system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early iterations generally focus on a single thread, prototyping critical
			functionality to insure that the system will work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Early iterations also focus on risk
			detection and critical risk reduction/elimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Further iterations continue to build
			upon this basis by adding functionality and further refining the foundation built during prior iterations.</p>
			<p>This approach also has the advantage of providing visible results much earlier in the project,
			which is usually very welcomed by project sponsors and the business communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also,
			often times system requirements are not well defined and the iterative process is an excellent
			way of discovering those needs prior to the system being completely built.&nbsp;&nbsp;By working
			in an iterative fashion, all of the stakeholders can get involved in the development process,
			greatly facilitating communication across the team, and ultimately resulting in a better end-product.</p>
