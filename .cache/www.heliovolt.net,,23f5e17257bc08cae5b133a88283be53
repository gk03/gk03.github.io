	<div class="entry-content">
				<p><img class=" wp-image-218 alignright" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-1.jpg" alt="wine 1" width="401" height="401" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-1.jpg 500w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-1-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-1-300x300.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" />It is a desire for wine lovers to keep their beverages at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">best temperature</span> in order to maintain the taste and aromas. If you cannot afford to install a wine cellar within the <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/latest-innovations-solar-power-smart-homes/">house,</a> wine coolers can be a better alternative. These wine chillers are capable of storing your wines at an <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/will-smart-thermostats-improve-houses-climate/">ideal temperature</a> range without draining your bank account.</p>
<p>Even though the size and configuration are some of the aspects to consider when looking for a viable wine refrigerator, you just need to understand <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the two options of wine coolers.</span> We have the compressor wine coolers and thermoelectric wine coolers, and they have different <a href="http://www.bgs.ac.uk/discoveringGeology/climateChange/CCS/whatIsEnergyEfficiency.html">energy efficiency</a> based on the size and configuration. Probably, no one will turn down an energy efficient wine cooler. We all want to reduce energy bills!</p>
<p>However, energy efficient in both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thermoelectric and compressor coolers</span> increases depending on unit&#8217;s size and configuration. It is worth noting that the two options can save energy depending on the capacity of a wine cooler you buy. A 28-bottle single-zone thermoelectric chiller uses up to 75 watts, while a similar compressor unit uses up to 85 watts. This means that this thermoelectric model is more energy efficient compared to its compressor counterpart. A 33-bottle compressor wine refrigerator uses 85 watts, while a 32-bottle thermoelectric chiller uses up to 150 watts.</p>
<p>From the above examples, you can see the variance in energy usage based on capacities. It is worth pointing that these coolers use Peltier devices to cool down the cabinets. The higher the capacity, the more the number of Peltier devices required for cooling. Therefore, energy efficiency will depend on size and configuration of a particular wine cooler.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t get into deeper details as far as<a href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/ee/ee-1.html"> energy efficiency</a> is concerned because different people need different kinds of wine coolers. The pinch of paying for energy is felt differently, and therefore everyone has the freedom to choose what best suits him or her. Am I too harsh? Alright, I just want to give you vital information about a few brands of wine coolers so that you can make a wiser decision based on your preference and budget.</p>
<p>So, the following are three best wine cooler brands to choose from;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Avanti Wine Coolers</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="wp-image-220 alignleft" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/avanti.jpg" alt="avanti" width="228" height="239" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/avanti.jpg 501w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/avanti-287x300.jpg 287w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />Avanti wine coolers are both <span style="text-decoration: underline;">elegant and practical</span>, and they come in different sizes. For instance, the Avanti 166 bottle wine cooler has a black cabinet, stainless steel handle and door frame. The glass door is double-paned, tempered and clear such that you can see all the bottles inside. Interestingly, you can house as many as 166 bottles in the spacious and sturdy wooden shelves. The wine refrigerator has an interior <span style="text-decoration: underline;">LED light</span> that can be turned on and off using a touch button, ensuring that energy usage is significantly controlled. In addition, the unit features temperature touch controls to store your whites and reds in the finest condition. It has an interior fan to adapt outside conditions without your involvement.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Danby Wine Coolers</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danby wine coolers are designed to fit all users because they are<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> highly portable</span> and come with black shelves. You don&#8217;t need to worry about kitchen renovation in order to create a space for the unit. Also, the black shelves provide elegance. The units come in a wide range of capacities to fit from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as few as 6 bottles to as many as 50 bottles.</span> The Danby DWC1233BL-SC is one of the best Danby wine coolers, with a capacity to house 12 bottles. The cabinet has a glass door, with a recessed handle to safeguard your sleeve whenever you pass by. The interior can be lit with the LED light, making the unit an additional interior décor.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Haier Wine Coolers</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img class=" wp-image-221 alignright" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-4.jpg" alt="wine 4" width="228" height="267" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-4.jpg 424w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wine-4-256x300.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 228px) 100vw, 228px" />Haier wine coolers are designed taking into consideration style and décor. The brand ensured that the coolers are in variety to suit different users including any wine novice out there. The units range from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6-bottle to 50-bottle wine coolers</span>, and still, there is a cellar to provide dual zone cooling. For instance, the Haier HVTM06ABS 6 bottle wine cooler can be suitable for any wine cooler, with no intention of storing a large number of bottles. Interestingly, you can choose the temperature range depending on the kind of wines you want to store.</p>
<p>Even though I have provided three brands of wine coolers, there are other many types in the market. However, the above brands have many models of different sizes to satisfy your wine keeping needs. But more importantly, look for a wine cooler suitable for what you want.</p>

As luck would have it, several technocrats have also been spending quality time thinking on how best they can increase the utility of these <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/the-ecological-dream-house/" target="_blank">smart homes</a>. One of these ways include coming up with solar power innovations that can achieve their desired effect.</p>
<h2>Electric car solar charging</h2>
<p>Solar panels have become one of the most essential devices to have in some smart homes. They have the ability to tap and harness the solar energy and convert it into a form that can readily be utilized by its user. Charging of electric cars has seen a joyous daybreak as they can now be charged by the energy harnessed by the solar rooftops – thanks to the developers. This increases convenience since the home owners no longer need to worry about the charging of their cars. The solar energy trapped by the solar panel is then utilized by the car in its charging through a cable connected mostly in the anterior part of these cars (but it depends on the nature and type of the car as others |ingest’ the energy via other parts of the car)</p>
<h2>The home energy management system</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-68" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-3-1024x731.jpg" alt="Latest Innovations In Solar Power 3" width="780" height="557" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-3-1024x731.jpg 1024w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-3-300x214.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-3-768x548.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-3.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" />The home energy management system abbreviated as HEMS is another innovation in smart homes. These systems run on small computers which have the potential of collecting all the solar energy consumption data from any electric meter of that home and its vicinage. These electric meters include the <a href="http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/how_pv_system_works.htm" target="_blank">photovoltaic system</a>, the heat pump, electric vehicle or any other general household device that records the amount of current that passes through it within a given period of time.</p>
<p>At any time of the day, the homeowner can track the individual and general power consumption. This is because the system has a display where the home owner can see and read the power consumption. In addition to that, it is from this system that the homeowner is in a position to access if the solar power available is able to charge his/her electric car.</p>
<h2>New advanced solar panels</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-2-2.jpg" alt="Latest Innovations In Solar Power 3" width="500" height="392" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-2-2.jpg 500w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Innovations-In-Solar-Power-2-2-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" />In most cases, the solar panels are the widely used intermediate device to harness and output the solar energy. Smart homes have another reason to embark on solar panels. This is due to several features introduced that guarantee high efficiency as far as harnessing and outputting is concerned. One such feature includes their design. They are currently manufactured with a uniquely concave design that automatically rotates to follow the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-Direction-Using-the-Sun" target="_blank">direction of the sun</a>. This is to not only ensure that they absorb as much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy" target="_blank">solar energy</a> as possible and also of relatively high intensity.</p>
<p>Technocrats have also found a way of increasing the solar panel efficiency and simultaneously lowering their cost. This is due to the employment of the very best silicon in the panel system. For maximum output possible, of late, high-capacity inverters have also been utilized. These produce a certain twist of innovation in the solar power industry.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The innovations in the solar power have greatly transitioned the way we live and manage our smart homes. All these latest innovations have made life simpler due to the efficiency achieved and also guarantees a relatively Carbon (IV) Oxide (CO2) free home since solar energy is known to be highly environment friendly. It’s time to adopt these innovations in smart homes.</p>

				<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-59" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-1.jpg" alt="The Ecological Dream House 1" width="625" height="319" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-1.jpg 625w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-1-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" />A standard ecological dream house, protects nature, provides modern comfort and provides modern comfort at its fullest. Its heating and air conditioning system is ecological and highly efficient with <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/08/tk-ways-fresh-air-impacts_0_n_5648164.html" target="_blank">fresh air</a> supply that is constantly renewed. The hygrometry is perfectly balanced, and consumes much less energy than conventional houses.</p>
<h2>Materials and Techniques</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-60" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-2-300x202.jpg" alt="The Ecological Dream House 1" width="300" height="202" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-2-300x202.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-2-768x516.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-2.jpg 855w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Each area of the <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/latest-innovations-solar-power-smart-homes/" target="_blank">ecological dream house</a> uses optimal construction methods for each equipment used for ventilation, heating, air conditioning and all the other areas. The design of the house is done in a way that the equipment and materials are precisely chosen. In addition to that, the energy requirements of the house are reduced to the furthest possible extent while making sure to maintain the modern comfort of the house. By taking care of the house design, the cost can be reduced to similar or even less than that of a standard inefficient house.</p>
<p>Air conditioning and heating of buildings and houses are one of the main contributers of carbon dioxide emission throughout the world. In France, they contribute to 93 million metric tonnes and more than 40% of energy consumed. Therefore, the dream ecological house is one that aims at reducing both the carbon dioxide emission and energy requirement by a significant amount more than a conventional house heated through electricity or gas. This can be achieved by building this house which is long lasting, efficient, and producing more energy than that consumed. This can be achieved using the following techniques.</p>
<p>At the planning level, the outer surface of construction should be minimized, where heat exchange with the surrounding occurs. This can be achieved through compacting the house to resemble a cube or configure it in a way that the main windows of the house face southwards. During summer, the shutters and awnings will protect the house from direct sunlight and direct heat. During winter, the heat from the sun will contribute to house heating. The walls should be thick as possible to ensure better insulation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-3.jpg" alt="The Ecological Dream House 1" width="537" height="359" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-3.jpg 537w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/The-Ecological-Dream-House-3-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" />The choice of materials to be used for building should be long lasting that provide insulation. These include insulating bricks, or low density concrete. Other materials that can be used include cellular concrete or insulating bricks that are much better than cinder blocks to achieve the same size of wall thickness. Insulating bricks have been known to have greater strength mechanically and the mason is able to build faster with them.</p>
<p>The masonry walls should have airtight joints including the doors, the windows and the rolling shutters. If this part of the work is executed properly, then the building will save a lot of energy in the course of its lifetime. Air tight joints are an element of a home that is highly efficient and they are easy to create.</p>
<p>The thermal bridge, where the outside walls and the floors touch should be broken. Concrete is a great heat conductor. Therefore, floors normally bring outside cold into the warm building. To solve this problem, blocks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polystyrene" target="_blank">polystyrene</a> can be laid at the external part of each floor before the concrete slab has been poured.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>An ecological dream house utilizes simple construction techniques and materials to preserve energy and reduce environmental pollution through reduced <a href="http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html" target="_blank">CO2 emission</a>. The extra cost of constructing such a house is negligible but the ultimate energy savings are significant.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-56" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-2.jpg" alt="How to Create a Self Sustained Home Using Solar Energy" width="622" height="378" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-2.jpg 622w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-2-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px" />Due to the introduction of technological devices like the solar panels,the use of solar power has gone global over the last few years.Unlike in the past where solar energy was used thermally that is as direct sunrays for drying,among other services,the use of photovoltaic cells in solar panels has expanded its range of uses. The US has not been left behind in the utility of solar power for self sustained homes. Self sustained homes have been created by <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/latest-innovations-solar-power-smart-homes/" target="_blank">use of solar power </a>through a number of ways.</p>
<h2>First is lighting;</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-55" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-1.gif" alt="How to Create a Self Sustained Home Using Solar Energy" width="498" height="275" />This has been made more efficient mostly by the use of solar panels that has two layers of silicon based semiconductor wafers and surface painted black for maximum heat absorption and minimum heat loss.</p>
<p>It’s usually mounted on rooftops to trap heat in form of photons and by photovoltaic effect the solar energy is transformed to electric energy.It’s used in various home appliances like televisions and bulbs used for lighting. Also,the solar lamps that are currently trending use solar energy for lighting and charging multiple devices like phones among others especially in remote areas.</p>
<h2>Second is heating water;</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-3.jpg" alt="How to Create a Self Sustained Home Using Solar Energy" width="527" height="352" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-3.jpg 527w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-to-Create-a-Self-Sustained-Home-Using-Solar-Energy-3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" />This asks for solar thermal installation which works under three platforms of heaters.A batch collector has solar absorber and storage tank working as a single unit.Its more efficient in countries that are warm throughout.In seasonal countries like Canada it would be coated with ice if left unprotected for long hence less effective.</p>
<p>An evacuated tube solar collector has several glass tubes with a black metal pipe each that transfers heat through fluid. Its used even in cold areas. Flat plate collector heater has sun heating fluids running through tubes in a box with a transparent cover which goes to the water system.It can be used in moderately cold areas.</p>
<h2>Third is pumping water;</h2>
<p>For various uses for instance livestock rearing, provide water for off grid homes and small scale san culture through irrigation. A solar water pumper contains a pump that maybe either surface or submersible. Surface pump works from underground sources like lakes and draws water vertically about 20 feets while submersible pump draws water from wells hundred feets above.</p>
<p>The controller regulates current between the solar panels and the pumps,prevents fluctuation of pumps and ensures that pumps don’t dry.A storage unit is required to store the water being pumped.This has helped increase productivity especially in growing plants like cabbage and capsicum that need controlled water.</p>
<h2>Fourth is cooking;</h2>
<p>Some ovens are designed with glass and reflective materials that absorbs <a href="http://www.space.com/17137-how-hot-is-the-sun.html" target="_blank">sun’s heat</a> like solar cells and magnifies it to make it hot to cook,grill and also heat food.</p>
<h2>Lastly;</h2>
<p>Solar power is used in pools and <a href="http://health.clevelandclinic.org/2014/07/hot-tubs-can-land-your-heart-in-hot-water/" target="_blank">hot bath tubs</a>. Lack of an inbuilt solar energy system calls for solar power kits from pool supply stores to convert the existing heater or buy solar power skimmers to clean pools and spas.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The use of solar power is here to stay. The greatest advantage with the use of solar power is that it utilizes a cheap source of energy. Once you have the required infrastructure in place, tapping solar energy is a sustainable <a href="http://energy.gov/science-innovation/energy-sources" target="_blank">source of energy</a>.</p>

				<h2></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-86" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Is-the-Future-of-Trash-3.jpg" alt="What Is the Future of Trash 3" width="640" height="481" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Is-the-Future-of-Trash-3.jpg 640w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Is-the-Future-of-Trash-3-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />Trash, especially food waste is a big challenge for most municipalities and households. If it is left out too long, it creates an <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-a-Bad-Smell-out-of-a-Garbage-Disposal" target="_blank">awful smell</a> and can act as a breeding source for infections. This problem becomes worse in the winter months. This is because snowfall may limit the ability of garbage trucks to come pick up the trash. The longer it stays outside, the more vermin and unwanted invaders it attracts.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-125" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal-300x275.jpg" alt="garbage disposal" width="300" height="275" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal-300x275.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In order to end this problem, the garbage disposal units were invented in the 1940s. These units were designed to shred food waste before it could be flashed down to the municipal treatment plants. However, this idea took quite a while to be accepted by most garbage management services. They thought the food would end up clogging the pipes, something they did not want to deal with. Later it turned out this were all in fact myths that had no backing in facts.</p>
<h2>The Main Advantages of Garbage Disposals</h2>
<p>Although it has taken the world to realize the benefits, they still have a role to play in our world. For one, garbage disposals reduce the carbon footprints of garbage trucks. Most garbage collection services deal with tons of food-related garbage every year. All this has to be moved to the disposal site using trucks, which consume a lot of fuel. In the process, they release emissions that lead to global warming. As per <a href="http://www.disposalmag.com" target="_blank">Disposal Magazine</a>, Garbage disposal units take care of this problem and reduce the use of trucks for garbage disposal.</p>
<p>Another advantage of garbage disposal units is that the food waste is directed towards the waste treatment plants. These plants can now be fitted with units that can process the food waste into organic fertilizer. This thus reduces the need for inorganic fertilizer, which wreaks havoc on our environment. The garbage disposals thus lead to a far more <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/newest-water-treatment-devices-home-usage/" target="_blank">stable ecosystem</a> thus conserving life on earth. The food waste may also be used for energy production, which is quite beneficial for the environment.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal-1.jpg" alt="garbage disposal" width="520" height="312" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal-1.jpg 520w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/garbage-disposal-1-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" />In the long term, users of garbage disposals will save huge costs on plumbing. Food participles tend to clog up piping and usually require expensive repairs. The garbage disposal unit sees to the fact that one uses less water to get rid of waste and reduces plumbing costs. This is because pipes are unlikely to be clogged due to solids.</p>
<p>For those who are worried about the rise in electrical costs, it has been proven that garbage disposals consume very little electricity. A garbage disposal consumes less than one percent of a household’s total consumption. In addition, there are now super quiet units for those who are worried about noise. One will hardly notice that there is a unit installed in the house. This has been made possible by innovations in motor technology over the past few years.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Garbage disposal units are clearly the<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/feb/23/future-of-waste-five-things-look-2025" target="_blank"> future of garbage</a>. They are good for the environment and they are good for the home too. There is clearly no reason not to have one installed.</p>

				<h2></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-114" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-2-1024x682.jpg" alt="How Will Smart Thermostats Improve Your House’s Climate" width="780" height="519" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-2.jpg 1024w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" />Recent studies indicate that almost 90% of people who use programmable thermostats never bother to adjust the thermostats. What this means is that <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/latest-showerhead-innovations/" target="_blank">the device ends up costing the home</a> more in terms of energy costs. Due to this realization, more people are now investing their money in smart thermostats.</p>
<h2>How Do Smart thermostats Work?</h2>
<p>These<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermostat" target="_blank"> types of thermostats</a> work by performing intense calculations; in the end, they come up with a figure that is most efficient for use in the home. These thermostats first get data on how much electricity is consumed in the home. The next step is to analyze the homeowner’s patterns. They get information on how they live and how often they are in the house. Additionally, they analyze the temperature settings that the homeowner prefers.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-113" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-1-300x229.jpg" alt="How Will Smart Thermostats Improve Your House’s Climate" width="300" height="229" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-1-300x229.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Thermostats-Improve-Your-House’s-Climate-1.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The thermostats are fitted with smart programming that takes about a week to gather all the information it requires. In addition, some of them come with a smartphone app that asks questions over time. These questions need to be answered correctly for the thermostat to perform its function correctly. The entire process will take about a week before the thermostat can take over running the house. However, there is always an option for corrections. If one feels the system is not working, as they want it, they can always feed it more data.</p>
<p>These systems also come with a monitoring appoint can keep track of a person’s whereabouts in order to determine if they need to <a href="https://weather.com/sports-recreation/ski/news/6-heating-mistakes-commonly-made-20141028" target="_blank">warm up the home</a>. This option can be turned off if someone does not want his or her life being tracked. Smart thermostats also come with motion sensors. These are great for telling if there is someone in the home or they just forgot their phone. The best part about these smart thermostats is that they are connected to the internet. Therefore, in the case of upgrades, they occur automatically without requiring any effort from the owner.</p>
<p>Another common problem with thermostats is sunlight interference. If the thermostat is hit with sun rays, this tends to mess with its readings. However, the smart thermostats have a feature that allows them to adjust this problem. They also have the ability to detect the outside temperatures based on data fed to them. This can help them make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Generally, these thermostats are a great way to control the house climate. For one, they have the ability to control room-by-room heating. This means that only occupied rooms get any heating. This can reduce the heating bill significantly especially in big homes. You may compare the energy saving stats from <a href="http://www.thermostatistics.com" target="_blank">thermostatistics.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Things to Observe</h2>
<p>In order for these thermostats to work properly, one will need to keep all vents unobstructed. It is also important to keep the air filters cleaned out. This can greatly affect the efficiency of these thermostats. It is also important to keep it away from sunlight, which may have a slight effect on its accuracy.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While these smart thermostats are awesome, they only work well with good data. Check it regularly to make sure it is working well and raise any issues that may arise. One could cut down their energy bill significantly with such a device.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Human beings have managed to set robots on the planet mars. In addition, we have managed to put various <a href="http://www.space.com/24839-satellites.html" target="_blank">satellites</a> in orbit around our planet and other planets in our solar system. However, all these discoveries were made possible by the invention of the telescope. This device gave early innovators a glimpse of space, which helped to raise curiosity in outer space. This eventually saw the modern man reaching outside the earth.</p>
<h2>A Telescope Comes Up with More Fun</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-111" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-2.jpg" alt="How Smart Telescopes Can Make Astronomy More Enjoyable" width="275" height="275" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-2.jpg 275w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-2-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" />One of the recent innovations in telescope technology has been computerization. For now, one does not even have to have a clue about the sky to start using one. For instance, smart telescopes come with a smart processor. When they are hooked up to a screen, they can immediately indicate to the user what they viewing. This is done through their unique ability to scan the stars and compare them to existing databases. This provides a unique viewing experience that is hard to find anywhere else.</p>
<p>Another unique feature is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lens" target="_blank">apochromatic lens technology</a>. This gives newbies of telescope an experience they could never have any other way. The technology minimizes color imperfections and star distortions. This means one gets a clear view of the sky and be sure they are seeing real images and not just screen smudges.</p>
<p>Another great technology that comes with smart telescopes is the use of applications. All one has to do is install an application on their phone and link it up to their telescope using Wi-Fi. The result will be that one can control the telescope using only the app, read telescope reviews for more on this features. One thing to note is that the night sky is always changing, as a result, an amateur might find it very difficult to find objects. With the application, the user only needs to tap on the section of the sky they want the telescope to point.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-110" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-1-300x225.jpg" alt="How Smart Telescopes Can Make Astronomy More Enjoyable" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Smart-Telescopes-Can-Make-Astronomy-More-Enjoyable-1.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Some of these telescopes are in fact robots with smart processors placed onboard. They will immediately take images of the night sky and combine them with GPS technology. From this, they are able to map their exact location and point to what the astronomer wants to see. This is something one can do with friends as a fun activity. Ordinarily, it would require that one has an in-depth knowledge of various celestial events and their timelines. Besides that, one would have to track these events using celestial maps. This map is not easy to decipher. For an amateur, it will look like similar bright dots spread irregularly apart.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>For amateurs who would like to purchase a telescope, it is important to choose one with a wide lens. In addition, make sure it is not too complex. Some features may look awesome but they can be quite hectic to operate. Another area to look at is location. If possible, one should move as far away from the city lights as possible. The light pollution at times hides awesome celestial events, which can be quite fun to view. Thus, a smart telescope would be a great way to enjoy a camping trip.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-107" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-1-266x300.jpg" alt="How Will Smart Tankless Water Heater Help Safe Energy" width="266" height="300" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-1-266x300.jpg 266w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-1.jpg 395w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px" />Tankless water heaters have not been around for very long. However, in the short period that they have been around, they <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/newest-water-treatment-devices-home-usage/" target="_blank">have made a noticeable impact on people</a>. Their popularity continues to grow in part due to advertising and in part due to the quality, they offer. For a long time, developments in water heating systems seemed to have plateaued. That was until these tankless systems were invented.</p>
<h2>How Do They Work?</h2>
<p>As the name implies, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_heating" target="_blank">heating systems</a> do not have a storage unit. Essentially, water is only heated when it is required. The heating system can either be centrally located or at the pint of exit. In the centralized systems, the water is heated much like the traditional way but the heater activates when the flow is detected.</p>
<p>The centralized system has some inefficiency. For one, it cannot reliably heat the entire house if all the outlets were being used at once. This can be a <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/grooming/ask-mh-shower-morning-vs-night" target="_blank">problem in the morning</a> when people are taking showers and others are doing dishes in the kitchen. To overcome this problem, the point of use systems were created. They can either be gas powered or electric powered. The choice of system usually depends on the costs of energy in the area where one lives. There is also less heat lost as energy travels through the pipes in this decentralized systems.</p>
<h2>How Do They Save Energy?</h2>
<p>The main way they do this is by ensuring water is only heated when it is required. With storage containers, the water may be liable to lose heat over time in the storage tank. In the storage tank systems, one always has to have a pilot light burning. This little flame consumes energy all year round. Cumulatively, it is a lot of energy that goes to waste.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-108" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-2-300x213.jpg" alt="How Will Smart Tankless Water Heater Help Safe Energy" width="300" height="213" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-2-300x213.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-2-768x546.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Will-Smart-Tankless-Water-Heater-Help-Safe-Energy-2.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Tankless water systems do not have this problem. The system only works when heat is required. The result is that over time huge savings in energy use can be seen. There is also the fact that traditional systems require quite a bit of time to heat up all the water efficiently. People who have been unfortunate enough to shower last know this problem. This problem is eliminated with tankless systems.</p>
<p>Another way in which tankless systems are more efficient is in the durability of the system. Most traditional systems scarcely make it through to ten years. If they manage to go beyond that, they are inefficient and require a lot of money to maintain. Tankless systems can have a lifetime of about twenty years. Furthermore, they require very few repairs. This is because they use few and durable components. This can lead to huge cost savings in the long term.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is quite clear that tankless water systems are quite efficient. In addition, they can fit into any size of a house and do not need special storage space and pipe coverings. People who want to buy these systems should consider a few issues such as the cost of energy and regulations in their locality. This will help them determine if they make any savings.</p>

				<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-2.jpg" alt="What Are the Latest Showerhead Innovations" width="680" height="471" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-2.jpg 680w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-2-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />Since their invention in the 20th Century, shower heads have continued to evolve and become more functional. From a simple device that simply allowed people to free their hands for bathing only, the shower head has gone a revolution in the few centuries it has been in use. Modern shower heads offer the ability to offload stress and even cut down on the water bill.</p>
<h2>Magnetic Shower Heads</h2>
<p>This shower head envisions all the challenges that a person faces when they are using a shower head. For one, <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/newest-water-treatment-devices-home-usage/" target="_blank">the presence of soap</a> in the eyes makes it hard to see where to place a detachable shower head. This technology employs magnetism to help individuals put the shower head back in place with little effort. They intentionally include an audible click to ensure one knows it is firmly in place.</p>
<h2>Shower Flow</h2>
<p>This is one of the best innovations in shower technology. The shower head comes fitted with technology that enables it to control the flow of water and there are various types to choose from, ranking from low to high with options such as rain shower also to choose from. However, this does no dull the showering experiencing. To get over this, the shower head is fitted with a way to mix air with water. Thus, one gets the same full effect of a shower while using less water. This is great for areas where water costs a fortune.</p>
<h2>Bluetooth Speakers</h2>
<p>This is another innovative idea for shower heads that is fast catching on. Instead of having the speakers close by in the bathroom, the shower head is fitted with speakers internally. This can be hooked up to any Bluetooth device for an awesome showering experience. One can play their favorite tunes as they take a shower, thus helping the mind to relax. The speakers are made waterproof this there is no risk of someone being zapped as they shower.</p>
<h2>Rain Shower Heads</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-104" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-1-300x245.jpg" alt="What Are the Latest Showerhead Innovations" width="300" height="245" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-1-300x245.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/What-Are-the-Latest-Showerhead-Innovations-1.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />This innovative invention has revolutionized how people take showers. It takes the form of a wide shower head, which sends down water in narrow streams just like rain. The rain or waterfall can be further enhanced using flow control. Essentially, the shower head mixes water with air and then increases flow. This leads to an awesome experience where one feels like they are standing in the rain from the comfort of their home.</p>
<h2>Variable Jets</h2>
<p>This is another major innovation in shower heads. Some shower heads come with over six different types of flows and jets. All these jets are essential for a<a href="http://www.gq.com/gallery/best-nighttime-shower-products" target="_blank"> relaxing shower</a> experience. The different types of jets can easily be switched using a simple dial. This makes the showering experience quite awesome.</p>
<h2>Finish</h2>
<p>This area has undergone massive innovation. Originally, shower heads were made of a similar style with a simple finish. However, now one can choose the finish they like on their shower heads. This is all part of interior design, where shower heads play an increasingly huge role. There is no reason for one to be stuck with a dull finish that does not relate to the interior of the bathroom. You can check more shower heads on <a href="http://www.finestshower.com" target="_blank">finestshower.com</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Since their invention over a hundred years ago, the shower head has become an important fixture in the house. It can be a source of relaxation and visual appeal. Choose wisely to get the best of both.</p>

In fact, more people suffer from stress related complications than any other time in history. Whether it is a mom running house chores or working in the corporate world, the body is prone to <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/causes/sym-20050894" target="_blank">extreme fatigue</a>. There always seems to be so much to do in very little time. A good massage chair is a great way for one to reward themselves for all their hard work. The technology has evolved in the recent past leading to some great capabilities for users.</p>
<h2>Recent Innovations</h2>
<p>Initially, massage chairs had a very basic operation. They were like a piece of industrial equipment, which was difficult to operate. One of the finest innovations in massage chair technology has been the variable speed invention. This gives a better massage, which does not feel like one is riding a rickety train.</p>
<p>The other innovation in massage chairs has been the inclusion of body scanners. These scanners have been crucial to improving the level of comfort in massage chairs. The scan the back and adjust to the unique contours of each back. This is essential in ensuring that one’s back muscles, which suffer the most fatigue, get a proper massage. You may find the further details of body scanning in <a class="" href="http://www.massagechairland.com">massagechairland</a> website.</p>
<p>Another important innovation has been the air bag technology. Most modern massage chairs now come equipped with many tiny airbags located all over the chair. These airbags are essential in massaging particular areas of the back. They <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/latest-showerhead-innovations/" target="_blank">help to improve blood circulation</a>, which leads to a more relaxed feeling.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-97" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Massage-Chair-Technologies-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="Latest Massage Chair Technologies" width="780" height="520" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Massage-Chair-Technologies-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Massage-Chair-Technologies-1-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Massage-Chair-Technologies-1-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Latest-Massage-Chair-Technologies-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" />Besides the use of airbags, there is also roller technology incorporated into modern massage chairs. This technology works by targeting specific areas of the person’s body according to their wishes. The rollers can also be used for arms massage, an area that was inaccessible to the older massage chairs.</p>
<p>There is also the inclusion of heating technology in a massage chair. This great technology has revolutionized the concept of massage chairs. The heat is similar to that used in spa massages. It can be targeted with pinpoint accuracy to the specific areas of the body. Additionally, most massage chairs now come with audiovisual technology. Most of them have an LCD touchscreen from which users can select their favorite audio or video. This serves to further increase the relaxation gotten from a massage chair.</p>
<p>The most talked about innovation in massage chairs has been the <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/science-questions/antigravity.htm" target="_blank">zero-gravity technology</a>. Every massage chair should definitely have this feature. It scans the body and adjusts itself. The position reached after adjustments make one feel as if they are floating in the air. This is the most basic but most important feature to have in a good massage chair. Additionally, <a href="http://www.massagechairlab.com" target="_blank">a good massage chair</a> must come with a remote control. This eliminates the need for one to move for the chair each time they need to adjust the settings.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Massage chairs have really come a long way since their inventions. The features mentioned above are just a glimpse of what is possible with technology. Further improvements continue to be made to these chairs up to date.</p>

				<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-1.jpg" alt="Kitchen Faucet Innovations 1" width="667" height="500" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-1.jpg 667w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" />A kitchen is one of the most important and most used places in a home. Water is a basic thing in the kitchen and is therefore indispensable. The water runs through the faucets on the sinks, showers and other water supplied areas in the house. In regard to that, kitchen faucets should not be underestimated when it comes to providing clean water through the kitchen. The position, make and size of the faucet play a major role in the accessibility of <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/newest-water-treatment-devices-home-usage/" target="_blank">water in the entire house</a>. The size and type of the faucet also makes work easier hence saves time. One should also consider the style and function of the faucet.</p>
<h2>Faucet Spray</h2>
<p>This is a kind of faucet which is made in a special angle to supply water with a force. It helps in sweeping away food and remains on the dishes. It has been made in a way that one needs to press a button and the water comes out in a spray form. This makes work easier by saving time while rinsing the utensils. In addition to that, it helps in cleansing the sink after washing utensils. The force of water removes dirt and food remains from the corners of the sink.

<h2>Tall Drink</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-94" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-2-300x195.jpg" alt="Kitchen Faucet Innovations 1" width="300" height="195" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-2-300x195.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-2.jpg 485w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Most of the modern kitchens contain faucets with higher spouts. This mostly helps in providing room for big and longer water containers. According to an article published by Sharon O`Malley in March, 2013, modern kitchen faucets innovations makes chores easier to manage. She also highlights that the prices of the modern faucets and sinks have increased compared to the older faucets which were made of ceramics.</p>
<h2>Controlled Flow</h2>
<p>Kitchen faucets should be controllable when it comes to the flow of water. There are entrepreneurs who have filled in the gap to provide this products and services. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moen_%28company%29" target="_blank">Moen</a> is a company situated in North America which uses modern technology to make faucets. They have various selections and designs of controlled faucets. Some of these include;</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-95" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-3-300x225.jpg" alt="Kitchen Faucet Innovations 1" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-3-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-3-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Kitchen-Faucet-Innovations-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />1. Faucets which respond to motion &#8211;</strong>The flow of water is controlled with a sensor when placing the hands on top of the faucet. Immediately you remove the hand, the water stops from flowing. These kinds are commonly used in five star hotels and modern homes. Thomas Tylicki, a Moen senior product specialist puts it that there is no other digital kitchen faucet that makes performing tasks in the kitchen easier and delivers this kind of experience.</p>
<p><strong>2. Magnetix – </strong>This type of faucet uses magnetic force to control the flow of water. Consequently, it leads to a significant reduction of water loss.</p>
<p><strong>3. io Digital –</strong> The flow and temperature of water is controlled using a remote control. The remote control contains buttons indicating the temperature in the water and the pressure the water is using.</p>
<p><strong>4. Power Clean –</strong> It is a kind of faucet technology that contains flash and improved power. The faucet has a handle on the side to control the flow by minimizing and maximizing the amount of water needed.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It is most people`s dream to make work easier in their day to day life. Work can be made easier in the kitchen using the modern technology of innovating and repairing faucets. Companies that offer efficient and affordable faucets have been opened and people should take this opportunity to improve their homes. Due to high demand of water and increase in population, modern faucets should be used to control water flow hence reducing water wastage through high consumption. The modern technology in the faucets also helps in maintaining good hygiene. This is due to easy cleaning of surfaces that water flow could not reach using old day’s faucets.</p>

				<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-1.jpg" alt="How Does a Metal Detector Work" width="600" height="347" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-1.jpg 600w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-1-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Metal detectors first came into prominence during the world war. They were used to effectively detect and avoid enemy mines. Since then, their use has greatly evolved. In addition, the technology used in these devices has been greatly upgraded. Now <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/smart-telescopes-can-make-astronomy-enjoyable/" target="_blank">hobbyists use them </a>for treasure hunting. A good metal detector can change one’s fortunes so make sure to pick the best metal detector for the purpose and read <a href="http://www.metaldetectorjudge.com/">metal detector reviews</a> before you start on your hunt.</p>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>A metal detector works using a very basic concept. IT works on the concept of <a href="http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/21st_century_science/lectures/lec04.html" target="_blank">electromagnetism</a>. This concept develops more than a century ago, states that electricity and magnetism are interconnected. In fact, each can be used to generate the other. Today, the concept is applied in a number of areas. For instance, in the airport and stadium security, these devices are used to detect the presence of metallic objects on people.</p>
<p>When a person is using a metal detector, they are transmitting a signal into the ground, which is about two feet deep. This signal is designed to interact with any metallic object that is located inside the earth. When the magnetic field comes into contact with a piece of metal, as it stimulates electrons within this metallic object. As a result, this metallic object generates a tiny electric current.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-90" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-2.jpg" alt="How Does a Metal Detector Work" width="851" height="564" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-2.jpg 851w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-2-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Does-a-Metal-Detector-Work-2-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" />The electronic current is what another coil located within the head of the metal detector detects. This coil is known as the receiver coil. However, the received current is obviously very weak. In order to increase the chances of it being heard, it is passed through an amplifier. The amplified signal is the transmitted to speakers located higher up on the metal detector. This is how the user knows if there is a metal object in the earth. It is important that the metal detector works mostly on surface area and not mass. For instance, if a coin is lying flat it will have a stronger signal than one that is upright.</p>
<p>This means that even in instances where one detects a weak signal it should not be ignored. The metal detector hovers over the area until one can pinpoint where it is located. Tilting the metal detector slightly when trying to pinpoint the target can help boost the signal.</p>
<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems one will face is ground interference; this is especially true in an area with high mineral content. For instance, when searching on a beach, the <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/Urchin/mineral.html" target="_blank">minerals from seawater</a> generate a constant interference. However, the signal generated by the sand is relatively stable. This has enabled developers to come up with something called ground balance. The metal detector is set to ignore the ground interference, which is stable over a wide area.</p>
<p>Another issue faced by metal detectors is discrimination. One may end up digging for worthless objects all day such as old nails and bottle tops. The best way to avoid this is to purchase a metal detector with discrimination. These detectors are designed to indicate the type of mineral depending on the signal. This is made possible through a microchip processor.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>That is how most modern metal detectors work. Except for a few upgrades, the technology has scarcely changed. When purchasing one, it is important to understand all the functionality possible with most metal detectors.</p>

				<h2></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-117" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-1.jpg" alt="How Nanotech Toilets Will Decrease Water Consumption" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-1.jpg 700w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" />Nanotech toilets are one of the fundamental components that will bring a positive transition in most of the homes in the world. The models of these toilets have it that they’ll replace the current &#8220;ordinary&#8221; toilets by solving hygiene and <a href="http://www.heliovolt.net/newest-water-treatment-devices-home-usage/" target="_blank">water related problems </a>associated with them. These toilets will be employing the concept of nanotechnology to produce very clean water through the application of the innovated treatment of human waste. In addition to that, these toilets will be convenient to use as they will be odor free.</p>
<h2>In-built water production system</h2>
<p>This innovative toilet will be characterized by a rotating mechanism whose role will be to move the waste into a nano-element holding chamber (as it simultaneously blocks any odor and guarantees the waste to be out of sight). According to Dr.Alison Parker, the lead of the project, some nanotech membranes will exclusively filter and ultimately taking water out as vapor. These vapors enter a chamber that is filled with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcHXUUuezuM&amp;noredirect=1" target="_blank">nano-coated hydrophilic</a>” beads which offer a large surface area for condensation to occur and trickle below into the collection chamber.</p>
<p>In addition to that, this water, according to him, will be basically pure since all the pathogenic microorganisms will be left at the bottom of the holding chamber. This clean water can be used in the house holds and thus minimizing the general water buying and also consumption. According to <a href="http://www.pickatoilet.com">Pickatoilet</a> Editor&#8217;s comparison chart, waterless toilets are 3 times efficient than flushing toilets.</p>
<h2>It’s waterless</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-118" src="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-2-300x225.jpg" alt="How Nanotech Toilets Will Decrease Water Consumption" width="300" height="225" srcset="http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.heliovolt.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/How-Nanotech-Toilets-Will-Decrease-Water-Consumption-2.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Every day, a substantial amount of many households’ water is generally lost in toilets, according to <a href="http://www.besttoiletguide.net/">Best toilet guide</a> website a reported &#8220;up to 1/3 of all house water usage going to toilets&#8221;, a significant amount of water. Thus, these toilets have come up with a mechanism to lower the amount lost in toilets by a significant margin. These nanotech toilets are generally crowned as &#8220;waterless&#8221; toilets. This is because, unlike other ordinary toilets, these won’t be requiring the user to use any water once he/she has visited it.</p>
<p>All the magic in its operation starts when you close the lid after using it. This unique feature makes these &#8220;green’ toilets be relatively cheaper to maintain. This is due to the fact that they lead to the general reduction of the water consumption within a household and also in other places like industries and offices.</p>
<h2>No external source of sewerage system</h2>
<p>Many toilets are characterized by accompaniment of a corresponding sewage. The fact that these toilets will make the presence of sewerage systems next to toilet an idea of the past is remarkable. These toilets won’t require any external source of sewage system as other toilets demand. This is because there is the element of intense recycling of the human waste.</p>
<p>Indeed, this saves a lot of water that would otherwise have been used. Thus, there will be a general decrease in the consumption of water without a corresponding decrease in its efficiency.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This revolutionary toilet is geared to provide a relatively permanent solution to over consumption of water globally. The extension of the <a href="http://www.nano.gov/nanotech-101/what/definition" target="_blank">nano-scale technology</a> to great innovations as seen by these toilets generally deserves standing ovations. This is a great idea which not only solves the water over consumption problem but also keeps other toilet-related threats (like diseases due to poor sanitation in toilets) at bay. When it comes to human waste management and minimizing the consumption of water as much as possible, then nanotech toilets will suffice.</p>
