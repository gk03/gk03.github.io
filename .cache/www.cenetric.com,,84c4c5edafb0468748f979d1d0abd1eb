                                            <p>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, four of the most important words in making sure your business is around for years to come. No one like to think about the sort of event that could close their doors for good, and many business owners choose instead to simply operate on the assumption that the worst will never happen to them. Unfortunately, statistics show that 1 in 5 companies will suffer a catastrophic loss, whether due to fire, theft, flood or storm damages, power failures, sabotage, hardware failure, or simple data corruption. And for those without a Business Continuity Plan in place:</p>
                                            <ul class="noList">
                                            	<li>43% never re-open</li>
                                                <li>80% don't finish out the year</li>
                                                <li>53% never fully recover their losses</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>The simple truth is, it CAN happen to you. Disaster can and will strike at any time, without warning.
