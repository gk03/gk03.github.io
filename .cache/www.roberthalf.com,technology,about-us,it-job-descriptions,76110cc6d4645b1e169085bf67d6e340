They also need tactical managerial skills to lead the IT department in attaining the company’s current and future technology goals. They typically have a degree in computer science or a related field and at least seven to 10 years of experience in IT management. In larger companies, the CTO may report to a chief information officer or a chief operating officer.

<h2>Technical services, help desk and technical support</h2>
<h3>Manager</h3>
<p>Managers of technical support services need extensive experience with supported software and hardware, as well as excellent interpersonal, business management and customer service skills. The position also requires strong leadership skills. Employers typically seek a bachelor’s degree in information systems or a related discipline with at least five years of operations and support experience, plus three or more years in a managerial role. Professional certifications such as the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) or HDI’s Support Center Manager certification, or experience with the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), also are valuable.</p>
<p>Typical duties include:</p>
<ul><li>Managing the daily operations of a firm’s help desk and support services</li>
<li>Managing staff, including hiring, training, scheduling work assignments and conducting evaluations</li>
<li>Monitoring response times, evaluating user satisfaction levels and making recommendations for improvement</li>
<li>Evaluating and managing technical support systems hardware and software and making recommendations regarding upgrades or changes</li>
<li>Negotiating, writing and reporting on internal and external service-level agreements</li>
</ul><h3>Desktop Support Analyst</h3>
<p>Candidates for a desktop support analyst position should have extensive experience with desktop hardware, software applications, operating systems and network connectivity. They must be customer service-oriented and proactive in anticipating and resolving problems while maximizing efficient use of computing resources. A bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field and three to five years of experience installing and supporting PC and laptop hardware and software are standard requirements, although some employers are willing to substitute work experience for formal education. Additional requirements may include professional certifications from entities such as HDI (Desktop Support Technician or Support Center Analyst), CompTIA or Microsoft (Microsoft Certified IT Professional or Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator).</p>
<p>Typical duties include:</p>
<ul><li>Maintaining an inventory of installed software, managing software licensing, and creating policies and procedures for upgrades</li>
<li>Working with hardware and software vendors to verify timely product delivery and ensuring that new equipment is installed and ready to operate on schedule</li>
<li>Analyzing and making recommendations for hardware and software standardization</li>
<li>Creating user accounts and managing access control based on company policies</li>
</ul><h3>Systems Administrator</h3>
<p>Systems administrators should possess strong problem-solving, analytical and communication skills, in addition to in-depth technical knowledge of the employer’s systems hardware and software. Employer requirements vary depending on system complexity, the types of operating and network systems being supported, and the size of the organization. Though some employers require a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field, others may accept an associate’s degree or technical training certificate. Three to five years of experience working with the specific types of hardware and software systems used by the company are generally required. Professional certifications such as the Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator (MCSA), Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) or Sun Certified System Administrator (SCSA) may be commonly sought by employers.</p>
<p>Typical duties include:</p>
<ul><li>Installing operating system software, patches and upgrades</li>

<li>Performing system backups and recovery</li>
<li>Conducting server builds</li>
</ul><h3>Systems Engineer</h3>
<p>In addition to in-depth technical knowledge of the employer’s software and hardware, systems engineers need advanced analytical, troubleshooting and design skills. The ability to communicate with technical and nontechnical users also is essential. Employers may require extensive knowledge of the development process, including specific documentation and quality assurance. Because of the broad range of demands that systems engineers must meet, candidates who have demonstrated strong project planning skills often have an advantage. Employers generally prefer candidates with five or more years of experience working with the specific hardware and software systems used by the company, as well as a bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience.</p>
<p>Typical duties include:</p>
<ul><li>Developing, maintaining and supporting technical infrastructure, hardware and system software components</li>
<li>Performing installation, maintenance and support of system software/hardware and user support</li>

They should have hands-on experience working with the hardware and software components of messaging systems such as Microsoft Exchange, Outlook, Active Directory and Lotus Notes, plus handheld devices, and a strong understanding of malware protection. Messaging administrators must be comfortable in a fast-paced environment with rapidly changing technology. A bachelor’s degree in computer science, computer information systems or a related field, plus at least two years of experience working with the messaging systems used by the employer, are standard requirements.</p>
<p>Typical duties include:</p>
<ul><li>Implementing, administering and maintaining email and groupware systems, including associated servers, operating systems, and backup and recovery programs</li>

In addition, they should have a strong technical understanding of the various hardware, software and networking systems being supported. Employer requirements depend on the help desk position level. Tier 1, an entry-level position, normally requires less than two years of work experience and may require an associate’s degree or completion of coursework at a technical school. Tier 2 positions typically require two to four years of work experience and may require a bachelor’s degree or a two-year degree and additional, equivalent work experience in a help desk setting.</p>
<p>Tier 3 positions often require four or more years of help desk experience, a bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field, and/or professional certifications such as HDI’s Customer Service Representative or Support Center Analyst or the Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) designation.</p>

Candidates should be outgoing and comfortable working with diverse groups of people while maintaining professionalism at all times. A bachelor’s degree in a related subject area may be preferred by some employers. Breadth of technical knowledge and at least one year of training experience also are required.
