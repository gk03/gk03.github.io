<h4>Technology Partners</h4>
We take pride in our relationships with other outstanding computer professionals. Especially 
those that have proven themselves especially helpful, and knowledable or both. In that vien we would
like to introduce to our visitors to two special people. One is James Larson aka " 
<B><i><a href="http://www.dst-corp.com/james">The Computer Guy</a></i></B>".&nbsp; Visit his site for a personal view 
into the mind of a very unique and wonderful person. The second is our own new companion company. 
Its called <B><I><a  href="http://www.toughguycomputing.com">The Toughguy Computing Co</a></I></B>. and we want 
you to think of them whenever you have a data or computer need that isn't being met.

<h4>Special Note for Our Heroes</h4>
Along with our success,
DST is thankful for the sacrifice our veterans made to keep us safe and
free. On behalf of Phil Larson, President and 6 year Air Force veteran,
DST is eternally grateful for your, and your families' service to our
country. Additionally, we would like to thank the police officers, fire
fighters and EMT personnel that keep our communities safe.
