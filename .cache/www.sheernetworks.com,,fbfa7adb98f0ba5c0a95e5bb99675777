Property prices are expected to increase by twenty percent each year, which means a very good earning performance over the next five years. Montenegro is also the hope of becoming a member of the EU in the coming years which should further push up property prices across the country. It is also interesting to consider that it is 0% capital tax and only 9% corporate tax, which makes Montenegro a very popular place for investment.Real estates in the &#8220;unexploited&#8221; locations of Montenegro, which includes mountainous regions, can indicate a growth of 100 percent over the next five years, it can be even higher at resorts that became as the most popular.</p>
<p>Anyone who is looking to invest in ski resorts in Montenegro should be prepared for a renovation project. This is because the vast majority of properties available for sale in these regions are aged and old-fashioned.  The majority of these properties need some work with style to prepare them to the modern standards required by the tourists around the world.</p>
