	<p class="style5">The internet is still expanding at an exponential rate. 
	The number of people online is expected to double again by the year 2016. 
	This has caused a huge boon in the domain name business. Domain names ending 
	in .com are naturally the most popular and are being snatched up at an 
	exponential rate. This is probably why I recent study shows the average 
	value of a .com domain name skyrocketing to over $2,595.</p>
	<p class="style5">Not everyone who is grabbing up the available domain names 
	have websites. The domain parking industry has become huge since the advent 
	of Google as a primary search engine. Domain parking pages are those pages 
	you find on the internet that feature a list of advertisements that link to 
	other websites. The top 15 domain parkers last year made over $150,000 every 
	single month. With the average parked domain netting over $100 per month for 
	the owner.</p>
