            <p>Just because it’s called “intelligence” doesn’t mean it’s smart. The detail that makes up what you do can either get in your way, or it can empower you to be more efficient and enable new successes. Even better, it can show you how to outperform your competitors.</p>
            <p>We can help you discover where the smarts are in your business intelligence—the parts that really matter to the efficiency and performance of your operation.</p>
            <p>Whether you are a non-profit or business, large or small, no matter what field you are in, call Fletcher Data Consulting and say, “I want my information to work for me, not against me.”</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Your business processes are the secrets that set you apart from your competitors. Automating those processes puts all your employees on the same track to efficiency and gives you the tools to stay in tune with everything your business does.</p>
            <p>Fletcher Data Consulting can help you find that clear path through the forest that your processes have become. We find or create tools that organize and streamline the myriad things you and your employees do. Then you will be free to get back to growing your business.</p>
            <p>Take back your business from the confusion and drudgery of work processes beholden to paper that can be misplaced or spreadsheets that only one person can access at a time. Call Fletcher Data Consulting and say, “I want my work to flow.”</p>
