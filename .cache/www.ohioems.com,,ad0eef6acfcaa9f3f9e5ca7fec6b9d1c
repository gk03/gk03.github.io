    <p>Dear Valued Customer:<br />First, we at N-Focus would like to thank you for being an Ohio EMS Client.  Unfortunately, due to decreasing market share and increasing development costs, we will no longer support future development on this product.  Therefore, on Monday, June 17th, 2013 all new feature development on Ohio EMS software will cease.  Support for the current version of Ohio EMS will continue until January 31st, 2014.  This means that you can still use our support line and report bugs until the end of January next year.  We will do our best to work on these fixes as they are reported.</ br></p>
    <p>We regret having to make this decision and wish you well as you look for an alternative solution.<br /></p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br />Greg Cordle<br /></p>
