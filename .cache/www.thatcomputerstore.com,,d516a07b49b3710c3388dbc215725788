<br /><br /><strong>As of June 2016 we have moved from our former<br />
Manchaca location to a direct-to-customer service model</strong><br /><br />
Though quite lovely, our new office is not open to the public. Instead we've geared it entirely to the highest quality repair of your electronic equipment. Here forward rather than bringing your computer to us we'll come to you! Many repairs can be completed in your home or business while you wait. Equipment requiring a visit to our shop will be picked up and dropped off at your home or business on your schedule.
<br /><br />
Since 2011 That Computer Store has been a part of Bielstein IT LLC, a locally owned and operated tech services company. We are not changing management or staff as part of this move. We're still the same team, at the same number, here to ease all of your computer concerns. 
<br />
<strong>Give us a call and we'll be right over!</strong>
