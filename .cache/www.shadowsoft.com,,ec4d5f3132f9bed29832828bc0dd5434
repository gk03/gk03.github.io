       <font size="+1">S</font>hadowSoft, Inc. is a Texas Corporation which
       specializes in four areas of business: Public Records database
       distribution, database consultant, e-commerce tool set, and Internet
       URL selling and leasing.
       <br><br>
       <font size="+1">A</font>t the core of our business, we believe
       ourselves to be a pioneer in the area of collecting and reselling
       <i>Public Records</i> databases.  Although we no longer actively
       promote this aspect of the business, we do have a number of customers
       who we have sold databases to since 1993 and we continue to meet
       their needs in this area today.
       <br><br>
       <font size="+1">A</font>nother service that we no longer promote
       but still provide is <i>Database design and consulting services</i>.
       As a result of managing numerous large <i>Public Records</i> databases,
       we have developed a staff of proficient database designers and
       programmers.
       Generally these skills are distributed to company contracted projects
       however, we welcome inqueries for individual hourly skilled needs.
       A few of our well know larger customers include: IBM,
       American Airlines, SABRE Group, EPRI, and PublicData.com.
       <br><br>
       <font size="+1">A</font>s the internet and the web have grown, so has
       our focus on providing database access tools and engines for customer
       web sites.
       Here, we have been successful in leveraging our skills into a growth
       sector to yield some very successful tools.
       Our web enabled tool set includes administrative aids which allows a
       single <i>non-technical / non-programmer / non-database person</i> to
       build and maintain many hundred or thousands of databases which may
       easily be viewed over the web.
       A high performance database search engine allows for sub-second
       responses to inquires which can span thousands of seperate
       multi-terabyte databases concurrently.
       Obviously, this technology works well with more modestly sized
       applications as well.
       Our kit includes a full function accounting system which allows
       online users to add themselves and begin using your e-commerse
       application.
       There are many back office aspects of the accounting system including
       invoice generation and credit card processing components.
       The accounting system is built on a scale to support millions of
       of customers.
       <br><br>
       <font size="+1">L</font>ast, we have acquired many internet URLs, and
       currently entertain offers to purchase and lease these pieces of
       property.
