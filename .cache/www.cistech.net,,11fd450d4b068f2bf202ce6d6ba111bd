                        <p> "We recently upgraded XA from a highly customized green screen R6 to a mostly standard R9 system. 
                          In an aggressive 4 month migration, we implemented full PowerLink capabilities, upgraded from AM to 
                          IFM, installed Electronic Commerce to replace our custom EDI solution, and implemented a graphical shop 
                          floor communications and control system.  This implementation transformed our business, helping improve our 
                          ability to meet customer demand while also increasing operating efficiencies and providing access to critical data. <br />
                          <br />
                          CISTECH worked with us on this project, providing assistance in every aspect of the migration. Despite the 
                          aggressive deadline, the project was completed on time and under budget.  This project was truly a success 
                          story, which would not have been possible without the leadership, diligence and expertise provided by the entire 
                          CISTECH team." </p>

                          our accuracy is 99% and our on-time delivery has improved to about 97% while reducing inventory." </p>

                          That increase in efficiency eliminated the need to add additional pickers, saving us the cost of that position. 
                          In addition, the real time material transactions we get with PPS have helped us improve our inventory accuracy." </p>
