	<h2>Your Premier Custom Software Provider</h2> 

        <p>We offer custom web servers that automate business functions.

        </p>
        <p>
        One company needed to process some specialty employement forms (WOTC). 
        We built a custom server for in house processing and a web server to take forms from the field.
        Now, these employment forms can be filled out by new hires in remote locations, 
        sent into the secure server in house, and then forwarded to the proper state.
        </p>

        <p>
        One company wanted to offer debit processing through the web.
        We built a web server to route debit card processing from remote locations into their host.
        </p>

        <p>
        One company wanted to bring gift card processing in house. 
        We customized our gift and loyalty product for their use.
        They are now able to offer some special products to their clients.
        </p>
	<p>Since we are a custom software developer, 
           any of our product offerings can be customized to meet your needs. 
           See <a href="services.htm">Services</a> for more information about our custom capabilities.</p>

	<h3>The Value of Standards</h3>
	<p>
	Back in the ancient days of early Greece, one area had very strong standards. 
	Pottery had standardized shapes and scribes took note of much of society. 
	The benefit was that trade flourished throughout that area. 
	A while later, the Dorian Greeks moved in with a more individualistic approach and trade fell off to only local actions. 
	In short, having standards over a wide area enhanced trade.
	It is a lot harder to sell when there is a lack of standards
	<p class="alignCenter"><a target="_blank" href="newsletters/2016/AugNewsletter.pdf">more</a> </p>

	<h3>What is the payout?</h3>
	<p>
	In any investment, it isn't just how much return that counts, it is how quickly that return happens. 
	The shape of the return makes a big difference in how much money winds up in your pocket. 
	Luck isn't just in how you play the game, but which games you play and when.
