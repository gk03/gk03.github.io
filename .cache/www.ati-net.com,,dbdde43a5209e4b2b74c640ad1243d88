  <h3>The Alexander Technique</h3>
  is an educational process that focuses on the individual; therefore what happens in a lesson depends very much on the needs of the student at the time. How we are using ourselves- the way we do things- affects the results we get. The Alexander Technique is a means of improving that use wherein people can further their own personal skills and activities. Olympic level athletes have used the Technique to improve their performance, as have leading golfers and business people. The person who learns to stop and take time, to think constructively about how he/she uses him/herself in every day life will find that this simple procedure can have far reaching results.
