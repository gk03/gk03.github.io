Come work for MacMedics, the company that revolutionized on-site Macintosh service, support, and consulting in the Mid-Atlantic region.                        <br/>
                      
                        <br/>
                        If your idea of a good day is decommissioning a Microsoft Exchange server, converting an office full of sick and sad PC's with new Macintosh computers, then you might be who we're looking for!
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        MacMedics is the Mid-Atlantic region's leader in Apple Authorized Macintosh service, sales, and consulting! We're looking for more Mac Techs and Engineers to join our award-winning team. In business since 1989, MacMedics has over 25 years of Mac Service coursing through our veins, so when it comes to service we don't mess around.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        As a member of our team you will be entitled to the following:
                        
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        1. A 40-hour work week. We love our work, but we know to be our best in the field our people need to be fresh and ready to think on their feet. Lots of IT firms promise big bucks, but they are weak on benefits and heavy on the hours.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        2. A competitive salary that matches your experience.  
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        3. A bonus plan that rewards you going the extra mile. If you can create results in a number of categories, you can add on serious dollars to your annual salary.

                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        4. A real full-time job with a paycheck every two weeks. Lots of IT firms are looking for Mac folks to help them, but many of them only want to "contract" the help so they don't have to pay benefits.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                       5. The best health and dental insurance money can buy, and MacMedics pays 75% of the premium! After 2-years of working at MacMedics we pay 100% of your insurance. And in both cases, not just for you, but also for your spouse and children.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        6. A 401K program with company match. We pay all the management fees and take whatever percentage or fixed figure you desire right out of your paycheck.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        7. A new MacBook Pro laptop computer, iPhone, and company paid iPhone service plan.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
