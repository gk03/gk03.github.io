<meta content="ComPro Systems, Inc. (CSI) was established in 1983. Initially, CSI provided computer systems and support for medical billing and tracking for the offices of medical practitioners. From this modest beginning, CSI has evolved into a company that provides diversified range of services and products. These products and services enhance the productivity and efficiency of organizations within the commercial and government sectors. CSI fulfills the entire spectrum of automation needs from micro &amp; mini computers to the multi-platform of computers and its connectivity. The mission of ComPro Systems, Inc. (CSI) is to provide state of the art and cost effective total solution to the intricate, technical requirements/needs of its customers. This mission is supported by a team of highly qualified and experienced personnel as well as by their knowledge of most advanced hardware products and software systems. CSI's established professional expertise in the areas of Systems Integration, Data Base Management Systems, Document Control &amp; Management Systems makes it uniquely qualified to meet the challenges of perpetually evolving automation needs of the customers." t supply it, we probably know who can and will make sure you know how to get it done. right answers within our company we have in excess of 50 years experience in the industry. we send our full staff to extensive training in the products we sell to make sure we are on the leading edge of the technology and products you need to make your jobs successful. each of our employees, from the warehouse to the front office, participates in technical sessions. our goal is nothing less than the ability to ensure that anyone who answers a phone in our offices can answer your questions. most of the time, we have heard of or seen the situation you are dealing with and can give you straight answers. the unfortunate reality is that many of the distributors that work around the fringes of our industry can't render the same service because they simply don't know the answers. even so called "specialists" many times can only scratch their heads and wonder why it didn't work. we work hard on the front end to make sure we know what you need to accomplish, not only what you use. as a result, we are able to ensure that you get the benefit of changes to materials and methods that can improve your process, and as a result, make you more money. the right products we have one of the most complete lines of products in the industry. the products of manufacturers such as arlon, gaska tape, hydra-tech, ipc firestop, mameco, nuco silicones, polyguard, paramount, sonneborn, tremco, and united coatings are on our shelves and ready for delivery to your office or site. we maintain extensive inventories so you don't have to. this means that once we have found the right product to suit your needs, we can deliver it to you with no delay. forget about hearing excuses that "it's on order" or "we have to bring that in". we fulfill 97% of all orders from inventory and according to our customers' schedule. if we can't, you'll never be penalized with extra freight and delivery charges. for many contractors, the uses of the various products is a maze of conflicting claims and confusing information. using the wrong product for an application can cause everything from a costly call back to a dangerous chemical exposure. we guarantee we will never sell you the wrong product, or you won't pay for the material. it's really that simple. we'll take the time to really understand your application, and steer you in the right direction. on time cascade is the only supplier in this industry that offers free local delivery of your orders. we maintain extended office hours during your busy season and will even open up on the weekend or in the evening to make sure you stay on schedule. things come up. something gets missed in your office. the last thing in the world you need is someone telling you that you have to drop everything and respond to their schedule. here, your schedule dictates how we respond. we will do whatever it takes to make sure you are able to complete your work in a timely way. why should you settle for less? under budget perhaps not surprisingly, under budget does not necessarily mean lowest unit cost. here's an example from a real life situation. a customer needed a case of sealant in a hurry because the material on the site ended up missing. unfortunately, it wasn't until the day's work had begun, so... even if we accept a cost of only $12.00 per hour in actual wages, this trip cost $21.60 excluding lost time on the job, overhead and profit. the company spent $21.60 in labor cost and $2.65 per cartridge for a case of thirty cartridges for a total of $101.10!... that's $3.37 per cartridge! to buy the exact same material from cascade, delivered within an hour as the result of a phone call to our office cost $2.95 per cartridge with no down time for a total of $88.50. the same issues apply for those who need materials via overnight service. we get the orders out, period. now, we can't guarantee that your site will be within an hour's response time from us, but what is your time on the job worth! let us look after the details that can put money in your pocket. we know that what really matters is the cost walking away from the job, not the unit cost. we can probably save you money in both cases, though. how do we do it? sealants, waterproofing materials and glazing products are our primary business, not a side line. we are focused on giving you what you tell us you want, not what we would like for you to want. we are so sure that we can give your a better source for you needs that we offer two separate guarantees if you are ever dissatisfied with any item we supplied you, simply draw a line through the invoice for that item and don't pay for it. if we give you a wrong product recommendation, you don't pay for the order, period. you are in business to make money. our job is to help you do it. if we can, we hope you will reward us with your business. if we can't, we don't deserve it. but, how will you know if you never give us a shot? so here's a risk free offer that you can take to the bank. open a new account with cascade. place an order and let us do our thing. if we don't exceed your highest expectations, return any product you don't use and don't pay for what you do use. we'll take the risk and bet on ourselves. what have you got to lose? only the hassles of the status quo. cascade sealants ... the right answers, the right products, on time and under budget.' http-equiv="www.compro.com">
