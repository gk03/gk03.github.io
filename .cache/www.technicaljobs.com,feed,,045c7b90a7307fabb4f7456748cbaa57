				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is very important for every employee to fully understand their employer’s policies as they relate to the use of personal devices before accepting employment and signing the BYOD agreement.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend exploded back in 2012. At that time, about 80% of employees were using personal technology for some business use, while just over 50% of employers officially endorsed the use of personal devices. That left employers with some catching up to do, especially in the area of Acceptable Use Policies and BYOD policies.</p>
<p>Before BYOD, the ownership and usage of company equipment, phones, cell phones, servers, and devices was pretty straightforward and most usage policies established the ownership of both the equipment and the data stored including email messages. While there were a few exceptions based around attorney client privilege, for the most part, any data created or transmitted via company equipment belonged to the company.</p>
<p>As BYOD became more acceptable and implemented in many more companies, the ownership of data, messages, apps, etc., came into question. The result was the development of BYOD Policies, the expansion of Acceptable Use Policies, and the expansion of non-disclosure agreements some of which became quite draconian even to the point of allowing the employer to fully “wipe” personal devices.</p>
<p>BYOD policies have evolved substantially over the past 2 &#8211; 3 years and many are sophisticated agreements between employer and employee. It is, therefore, very important for every employee to fully understand their employer’s policies as they relate to the use of personal devices before accepting employment and signing the BYOD agreement. It is particularly important for technical employees who will likely be exposed to more sensitive and valuable data, algorithms, and processes. It is likely that your device and the data stored on it is addressed in multiple locations including non-compete/non-disclosure agreements, acceptable use policies, BYOD policies/agreements, data security policies or others.</p>
<h2>Here are a few tips that can help you evaluate and understand BYOD Agreements</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read all the documents you are asked to sign. Make sure you understand your employer’s BYOD policy and all others.</li>
<li>Understand how the documents you sign could be implemented. Ask for examples.</li>
<li>Look for specific definitions of what your employer is permitted and not permitted to do with your personal device and your personal data stored on that device.</li>
<li>Similarly, look for specific definitions of what you are allowed to do with company data on your device.</li>
<li>Ask questions – make sure you get answers to any questions you have. Some include:
<ol>
<li>“Am I required to bring a device, or is it optional?” and “If I elect to not use my own device, will the company provide me with the equipment needed?”</li>
<li>“Under what conditions could my device be searched by the company?”</li>
<li>“Could the company “wipe” all my data from my device?”</li>
<li>“Is there an independent advocate for employees related to company access of my personal device?”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Consult an Attorney if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Components of a typical BYOD Policy</h2>
<ol>
<li>A specification of permitted devices – typically a list of the specific devices or device types permitted and/or those that are specifically NOT permitted.</li>
<li>A Security Policy – including an explanation of required passwords, device sharing, network access, etc.</li>
<li>A Service Policy – what service is the company responsible for and what service is the employee responsible for. This area typically includes definitions of:
<ol>
<li>Initial Connection Support</li>
<li>Support for broken devices</li>
<li>App Support</li>
<li>Loaner Devices</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Data and App Ownership Definitions – A clear definition of data, app, and password ownership on personal devices.</li>
<li>Permitted or Banned Apps – Companies typically provide a list of specifically approved and banned applications.</li>
<li>Integration with the Acceptable Use Policy – most BYOD policies will rely on the existing Acceptable Use Policy which defines limitations on content, data, and other actions.</li>
<li>An Employee Exit Definition – this is a clear explanation of the responsibilities and actions each party may or will take related to all personal devices upon termination of employment.</li>
</ol>
<p>A BYOD policy can be a benefit to both the employer and the employee and is not a document to be feared.  It is, however, a document like all other employer policies that should be fully understood.  Taking the time to read and understand the Bring Your Own Device policy ensures that you can comply with the terms and never get surprised.</p>

This statement couldn’t be farther from the truth. Companies that use recruiters are hiring highly technical and very specialized people. These people are usually already employed and are not part of the layoffs and cutbacks.</p>
<p>The technical recruiting world is full of challenges and these challenges revolve around finding a very specialized candidate for a client’s very specific job requirement. It’s not easy!</p>

You’re invited to the face-to-face interview where you’ll probably meet with the hiring manager, some peers in your department, an HR Manager and possibly the IT Manager or the CTO. Everyone will have questions for you, and since you’ve already passed the initial screen and gotten in the door, all they are really assessing at this point is how you’ll handle yourself in the department, how you’ll work with the team and how you’ll interact with users. You could handle yourself perfectly but still blow the interview by asking some really dumb questions.<br />
There will be a point in the interview where you get asked, “Do you have any questions for us?” Never ask “Do you allow casual dress on Friday?”, “When can I get promoted?”, “Why did the last person leave?”, “What does the company actually do?” You need to be prepared with questions about the company, the IT Department or your role in the job.<br />
If you prepare some solid questions ahead of time, you’ll be ready to handle that part of the interview.</p>

<p>One of the things I look forward to in the New Year is reading the technology predictions from the editors or bloggers for various tech sites on the internet (Forbes, InfoWorld, Global Knowledge, Information Week and Fast Company).  They do their analysis and attempt to predict what will be going on in technology, software languages, networking, mobile apps, social networking, cloud computing, smart phones/tablets and other tech areas.  Since I’m a technical recruiter, it’s important for me to see what’s coming up in future.  They have the crystal ball and I don’t!!  Will they be right?  I’ll follow up next year and see how well they performed in their analytical skills.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.technicaljobs.com/files/2012/01/iStock_000011655390XSmall1blog2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-400" src="http://www.technicaljobs.com/files/2012/01/iStock_000011655390XSmall1blog2-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></strong></p>
<p>I had lunch recently with a friend of mine who is an IT Manager.  He had been job hunting for 6 months and had just landed a new position.  That’s tough to do in this job market.  He started the lunch conversation with a thank you for my help in his getting the job.  Since I didn’t do anything to get him the job, I couldn’t imagine what he was referring to.  It seems that I gave him some LinkedIn advice back when he first started the search.  I had told him to make his LinkedIn profile into a marketing tool.  He had followed my suggestions and added the words “Actively pursuing a new opportunity” to his profile.  He also included a way for employers to contact him in the contact section at the bottom of the profile.  The good news is that he got found on LinkedIn and is now a Program Manager and will be starting the new job next week—all thanks to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>This might be good advice for anyone on LinkedIn who is job hunting:  (1) include words to indicate that you are actively seeking employment (2) include some kind of contact information (phone or email or both) in the bottom section of the page (3) develop your profile so that hiring managers or recruiters can see your skills and accomplishments.  LinkedIn is a great marketing tool.</p>
