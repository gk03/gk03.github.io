            <ol>

If you elect to use paid aspects of the Services, you agree (i) that we may charge you monthly for a proportional amount of the Services you have selected (e.g., if you elect a quarterly subscription, we may charge you for such quarterly subscription in equal monthly installments) starting at the beginning of your subscription, (ii) that your subscription will automatically renew for successive periods equal to the duration of your initial subscription (e.g., if you elect a quarterly subscription, your subscription will renew for quarterly periods) until you or we cancel your subscription, (iii) to the pricing and payment terms we may provide to you via the Services, as updated by Glasshouse from time to time, and (iv) to provide our third party payment processor with a credit card, debit card, or other payment method acceptable to our third party payment processor as consideration for such Services.

You agree that the cost of any one-time Service is separate from and in addition to any subscription fees for the Services.</p>
        <p>All financial transactions made in connection with the Services will be processed by a third party payment processor in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and any other applicable payment terms and conditions.

However, you acknowledge and agree that Glasshouse has no obligation to provide a refund for any services purchased on or through the Services. Further, in the event that Glasshouse suspends or terminates your use of the Services or these Terms, you understand and agree that Glasshouse has no obligation to provide, and you may not receive, a refund of any kind, including for any subscription fees for any portion of the Services, or for anything else.</p>
        <p>You may cancel any authorized Services (excluding Pending Services and Services that are in progress or have been completed) without incurring fees or penalties by providing notice to Glasshouse at any time 48 hours prior to the scheduled time for performance of the Services.  If you wish to cancel a Pending Service prior to the scheduled time for performance of the Services, you may be responsible to pay a minimum fee, if applicable, and you will be advised of fee at the time you book the applicable Pending Service. If you wish to cancel any Services that are in progress or that have been completed, you will be responsible to pay for the full amount of such Services.</p>

            <h4><strong>TERMINATION</strong></h4>
        </p>

If you wish to terminate your account, including any subscription, and cease use of the Services, you may do so  at any time, by contacting us at happytohelp@glasshouse.com.  Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnification obligations, limitations of liability and terms regarding disputes between you and Glasshouse.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>NO WARRANTY.</strong> The Services may be unavailable from time to time for maintenance or other reasons. Glasshouse shall have no responsibility for any interruption, delay in operation or transmission, unauthorized access to, or alteration of, the Services or any Content. ALL USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES AND ANY CONTENT AND INFORMATION PRESENTED ON THE WEBSITE OR VIA THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS,” “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TIMELINESS, ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, RELIABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR SAFETY. GLASSHOUSE AND ITS AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY, “GLASSHOUSE PARTIES”) MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE WEBSITE, CONTENT OR SERVICES, OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES AND ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT, AND (II) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION STORED THEREIN. THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SERVICE OR PRODUCT ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE SERVICES OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND NONE OF THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES WILL BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.
        </p>
        <p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES NOR THEIR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO THE WEBSITE, CONTENT, AND SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT THE WEBSITE, CONTENT AND SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE; NOR DO THEY MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES. NEITHER THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES NOR THEIR LICENSORS WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES ARE FREE FROM VIRUSES, WORMS, TROJAN HORSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  GLASSHOUSE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF YOU OR ANY USER.</p>
        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <p>IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES. FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THESE TERMS, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE AND ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES OR THEIR LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PERSON CLAIMING THROUGH OR UNDER YOU FOR ANY LOST DATA, LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, GOODWILL, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, OR FOR ANY COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR INFORMATION, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, ARISING FROM YOUR ACCESS OR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES, INCLUDING THE WEBSITE AND OUR APPS, OR ANY OF THE CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE WEBSITE OR OUR APPS, EVEN IF THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES ARE AWARE OF OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM OR IN RELATION TO HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES OR ANY OTHER USE OF THE SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE GLASSHOUSE PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
        <p>YOU AGREE THAT THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS IN THESE TERMS THAT LIMIT LIABILITY ARE ESSENTIAL TERMS OF THESE TERMS AND THAT GLASSHOUSE WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS BUT FOR SUCH LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY; YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY TO INDUCE GLASSHOUSE TO GRANT YOU THE RIGHTS SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
        <p>The Services are made available from Glasshouse’s facilities in the United States. Glasshouse makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use your geographic location, whether within or outside of the United States. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.

        <p>
            <strong>INDEMNITY.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold the Glasshouse Parties harmless from any claim, cause of action, suit, proceeding, or demand, whether brought by third parties or otherwise, due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms and any use of the Services other than as expressly permitted in these Terms, and to pay any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses, judgments and awards, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. The foregoing indemnity obligations will survive any termination of the Terms or your use of the Services.  Glasshouse may, at its own expense, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, which will not excuse your indemnity obligations under this section. You agree not to settle any matter subject to the foregoing indemnification obligations without the express consent and approval of Glasshouse.

        <p>
            <h4><strong>ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW</strong></h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Arbitration.</strong> ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.  THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. §§1 ET. SEQ. (“FAA”) AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THESE TERMS OF USE. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.  HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THESE TERMS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.
        </p>
        <p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Glasshouse of your intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Glasshouse should be sent by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to Glasshouse Corporation, 370 Highland Avenue, Suite 200, Piedmont, CA 94611. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.  The arbitration will be conducted by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.  The Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.</p>
        <p>Such arbitration shall be conducted in Oakland, California, in the English language.  The arbitrator shall establish procedures under which each party will be entitled to conduct discovery.  The arbitrator shall award only such damages as are permitted to be awarded pursuant to these Terms.  The arbitrator must render an award within 30 days following the last hearing scheduled by the arbitrator and at that time state the reasons for such award in writing.  Except as set forth below, the arbitral award shall be final, binding and incontestable and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  An appeal may be taken under the JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure from any final award of an arbitrator in any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms that is conducted in accordance with such procedure.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the appeal tribunal, the appeal shall be conducted at the place of the original arbitration.</p>
        <p>Except as otherwise provided for herein, Glasshouse will pay all JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator fees.  If, however, the arbitrators find that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the Rules.  In such case, you agree to reimburse Glasshouse for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.</p>
        <p>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Governing Law.</strong> These Terms are governed by the FAA and the internal laws of the State of California, without reference to principles of conflicts of laws or choice of law rules.  For any actions for which either party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, at Glasshouse’s request, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Alameda County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and you hereby waive all defenses for lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to such courts.

            <h4><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION</strong></h4>
        </p>
        <p>We collect the information described below regarding you and other users in connection with the Services. As some of our Services are provided to you through third party providers, such as contractors, such third party providers may collect information from you and provide it to us for use, maintenance, storage and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Such providers are prohibited from disclosing your information except at our direction consistent with the services they are contracted to provide and this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process, use of the Services or your account settings, we may collect information such as your name, home address, email address, phone number, date you purchased your home, home security information (e.g., alarm codes, etc.), home systems and appliances information, dates of remodels or replacement of goods, information regarding the materials and goods used in your home (e.g., carpet, paint, etc.), dates and information regarding Services you receive from Glasshouse and similar information. We may also collect publicly available information regarding your home such as tax and property data. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of the features of the Services.</p>
        <p>We use the information described above to operate, maintain, improve, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Services. We may also use this information to communicate directly with you regarding the Services and in some cases to make available offers from Glasshouse or third parties that are related to the Services (“Offers”).  If you do not wish to receive Offers, you may opt out of receiving such Offers by emailing us at happytohelp@glasshouse.com.  If you opt out of receiving these messages from Glasshouse, you may not receive aspects of the Services.  We also use your information to send you Services-related emails (e.g., changes/updates to features of the Services, technical and security notices, etc.). You may not opt out of such Services-related e-mails.  If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to cancel your account in accordance with the Terms.</p>
        <p>If you download our mobile application and the Services are not available in your geographic location, you will have the option to provide us with your email address and zip code so that we may notify you when the Services become available in your geographic location.  If you choose to provide us with this information, we will use it solely for this notification purpose.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>COLLECTION OF DATA USING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY.</strong> Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record usage information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services, including our applications, are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit the acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from receiving some of our features. You can find out more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at www.allaboutcookies.org.  Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies and practices.
        </p>
        <p>We use or may use usage data collected through cookies or otherwise to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Website or Services; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) provide, improve and monitor the effectiveness of our Services or other businesses of Glasshouse or any of its successors’ or affiliates’ businesses, products or services; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.</p>
        <p>We may aggregate or anonymize information collected through the Services so that the information does not identify you. We may use or disclose aggregated, anonymized and other non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, including for research and marketing purposes, and our use and disclosure of such information is not subject to restriction.</p>
        <br />

        <p>
            <h4><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></h4>
        </p>
        <p>We may share your information with third parties as described in this section.</p>
        <p>We use other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide the Services to you (e.g., email providers, contractors, payment processors, cloud hosting providers, content or service fulfillment, analytics companies, etc.). Those business partners will be given limited access to your information that is reasonably necessary to deliver the Services. We use third party payment processors to collect and store your payment card information and to process payments in connection with the Services.  Any information that you provide to our payment processors is governed by each processor’s separate privacy policy instead of this Privacy Policy.  We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.  Glasshouse neither collects nor stores your payment card information on its servers.</p>
        <p>As noted above, we may anonymize your information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.  We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual.</p>
        <p>We may buy or sell, divest or transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and businesses. Your information such as your name and email addresses, and other user information related to the Services (as described herein) will likely be among the items transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, liquidations or similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.</p>
        <p>We may disclose your information to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties in our discretion in connection with any alleged violations of the Terms, violations of law or otherwise at the request of law enforcement officials or governmental entities.  We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information at the request of law enforcement officials or governmental entities, or that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Glasshouse, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
        <br />

        <p>
            <h4><strong>DATA STORAGE AND SECURITY</strong></h4>
        </p>
        <p>Your information collected through the Services may be stored and processed in a cloud environment, in the United States or any other country in which Glasshouse or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. By using any portion of the Services, you consent to the storage and processing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Glasshouse may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Glasshouse or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and information by selecting and protecting your password and any other sign-on mechanisms appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your account and other information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Glasshouse or guarantee that information on the Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
