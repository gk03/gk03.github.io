				<h1>Career Opportunities at Security PS</h1>
				<h2>We're Building Our Team</h2>
				<p>
				Security PS is looking to hire high-quality individuals to join our Kansas City metro area team. <!--We currently have consulting and administrative positions to fill:
				</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#PositionSeniorAppSec">Senior Application Security Consultant</a></li>
	<li><a href="#PositionAppSec">Application Security Consultant</a></li>
</ul>

<h3> Why Work at Security PS? </h3>

<p>Security PS is an established company that has earned a high reputation in the industry for delivering quality work and for its excellent team of consultants. Internally, we have developed a reputation for our culture and environment that helps our team grow and stay effective.</p>

<p>The work environment at Security PS provides a supportive team environment that gives opportunity for growth and ongoing professional development in a range of areas. Designed to fit the work style of our team, we've moved away from the formal office and have adopted a virtual office style but with a local team presence. This allows us to work flexibly from home, collaborate virtually, and also have the opportunity to meet and collaborate face to face as well. Regular team events and hangouts also add to the collaborative team culture.</p>

<p>While extensive travel schedules and considerable overtime work become expected of consultants in other firms, we’ve intentionally sculpted our culture differently. We believe that supporting a healthy work-life balance helps us to be stronger and more effective consultants. For example, our company values cultivating long-term relationships with businesses in our region, which means that travel requirements are low for our team, and yet we can easily provide face to face collaboration and help for our clients when needed. Also, our company recognizes that our team is more effective and productive when we plan well enough to maintain a 40-45 hr work week on average.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering how all this stacks up, ask our team. We love it. So, if you're looking to be a part of an excellent team at a well-established company that purposely maintains a team-oriented, smaller company feel, Security PS may be the place you’re looking for. </p>

<!-- start content --			
<p>	Security PS is actively seeking out an experienced application security specialist to join our team as a Senior Security Consultant. Once established on the team, the senior consultant will lead application security engagements including activities such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Application Penetration Testing 
(Web Applications, Thick-Clients, Web Services, Mobile Applications, and more)
	<li>Threat Modeling
	<li>Architecture and Design Reviews
	<li>Code Reviews
	<li>Writing Secure Coding Patterns
	<li>Training Developers
	<li>Developing and Delivering Custom Consulting Solutions
</ul>

<p>Team members are also given the opportunity to cross-train and participate in network penetration testing and enterprise security engagements as a part of their ongoing professional development.</p>

<p>On our team, Senior members provide leadership on the team by developing other consultants, creating new offerings or services, providing oversight for others’ projects, as well as provide consulting expertise in their areas of research. All consultants interact directly with clients and are responsible for writing detailed documentation, therefore it is imperative that candidates excel at written and verbal communication.  </p>

<p>Our expectation is that a person well suited for this role would have the industry experience necessary for the position and would undergo a 4-6 month training period to learn and become proficient with our engagement and testing methodologies.</p>

<p>Security PS invests in the training and professional development of each team member. For the right candidate, we may consider a person for this position who demonstrates the capability but is currently lacking some areas of experience required to prove qualification. In this case, we would provide a longer training period with targeted professional development goals for achieving the qualifications and experience required for a senior consultant.
