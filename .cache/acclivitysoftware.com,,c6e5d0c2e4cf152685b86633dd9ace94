            <h3>Scott Davisson</h3>
            <h4>Co-founder</h4>
            <p>Prior to helping form Acclivity, Scott Davisson oversaw MYOB’s sales and marketing efforts. Now he mainly obsesses over font size and exclamation points (or lack thereof). Scott has a diverse background in the software industry, including time spent with Intuit managing their ProSeries product line. We still let him in the office, since he owns half of it and all. He received his MBA from San Diego State University and his undergrad from University of Florida, which has a much better football team (Go Gators). While he runs and bikes at lunch, he refuses to run with Tom because Tom’s too fast. He did manage to finish the Philly Triathlon, though he nearly drowned. An amateur movie buff and aspiring chef, Scott lives in Montclair, NJ with his wife and two rapidly growing children and he swears the US will win the World Cup in his lifetime.</p>

            <h3>Tom Nash</h3>
            <h4>Co-founder</h4>
            <p>Before teaming up with Scott for the big Acclivity Management Buyout of 2005, Tom Nash served a variety of roles in MYOB, starting way back in 1992. In that time, Tom’s duties have spanned marketing, product management, a stint in Canada (the first time), and writing jokes for his annual Partner Conference presentations. Currently Tom’s main focus is products and technology, but don’t underestimate him in a marketing meeting, unless he’s daydreaming about lunchtime, when he’ll go out and run 10 miles or bike 20. I’d give you his Boston Marathon time, but that might trample his modest sensibilities (psst, it’s 3:14:30). When not tweeting about AccountEdge, he is most likely at a live concert or event of some kind. He’s cultured like that. Tom lives in Randolph, NJ and NYC with his wife and claims to make better espresso foam than Ed.</p>

And the facility (which includes the kitchen, the bathrooms and the heat - all important). That’s a lot to be in charge of.

                        <p>Rachel is one of our crack software developers, taking great pride in the product that goes out the door. As she should. She helped build it. Before studying computer science, she was an art major, so sometimes you can catch her just staring at the screen, admiring her work. When not spending copious amounts of time with her two girls, she’s often feeding her love of photography.</p>

                        <p>Juron’e likens his Customer Care role to being in the teaching profession. Not surprising, considering one of his chief tenets is that “you can always be learning”. In his free time he’s tinkering on computers or cars. Here, he’s learning about accounting, software and small business, then sharing what he’s learned with others. Guessing that his thoughtful, learning mindset is more useful here than it was during his days of construction site clean-up.</p>

Yes, I had to look it up too. Third largest non-continental island in the world and located north of Java, Indonesia (per Wikipedia). How cool is that? While we're toiling in the winters of New Jersey, Brian's surrounded by the South China  and Sulu Seas (more Wikipedia). But while you can take the boy out of the US, you obviously can't take the US out of the boy, as evidenced by his dedication to Fantasy (American) Football. We're just happy he's got a strong background in quality software development, having once built a team from 10 to 70 strong. Just as impressive as having once climbed Mt. Kenya, which is the second highest mountain in Africa (how awesome is Wikipedia?).</p>

Let's try anyway: Customer Service Rep, Technical Support Rep, Nationwide Training Program Creator, In-house Trainer, Technical Communications Writer. Needless to say, Cathy is flexible and open to new challenges. Which makes sense because in her free time, when not building churches in Guatemala, it’s a good bet she’s on the open road with her husband and her Harley.</p>

He’s also as adept introducing people to the capabilities of the software as he is helping troubleshoot tricky issues. An avid aviation enthusiast, David’s ideal August day would be spent in, of all places, Oshkosh, Wisconsin at the world’s biggest airshow. And, here’s an interesting tidbit, he used to fight forest fires. That call center segue way writes itself.</p>

Though there’s no evidence that his proficiency in Spanish helped him to realize his biggest achievement to-date: a 250 Gamerscore (note: the author had to Google what that meant. Old). At Acclivity, Kevin’s all about two things: the coffee and the customers. The coffee, presumably, because he has a penchant for caffeine, and the customers because he’s an all-around helpful guy. Bouncing between tech support and customer service and whatever else is needed on the day, Kevin has quickly become an Acclivity Swiss Army Knife. Metaphorically speaking, of course.</p>

Riley is also a true water dog who loves swimming (he's even been caught dancing on his neighbor's pool cover). He can perform a wide array of circus tricks (tell him "bear" and he'll balance on two hind legs for a treat). Riley adores people and is downright needy for human attention, which Acclivity office members are happy to provide.</p>

Responsible for all businesses touching our existing customers (e.g. upgrades, payroll, support, services) she is the internal customer advocate aka Loyalty Manager. She has spent the better part of the decade contemplating Payroll and re-doing her kitchen, in no particular order. She’s an outdoor enthusiast, has stood face-to-face with a bear and once won a lawsuit on someone’s behalf without anything resembling a legal degree. Impressive.</p>

                        <p>Kevin has many love/hate relationships. Dairy, for instance. Loving ice cream. Cottage cheese, not so much. Clothes. On one hand, loving them, or at least accepting their utility, while simultaneously hating to fold them (that job at The Gap the obvious low point in his professional life). But complex technology problems that don't have straightforward answers? It's just love/love. A technical magician (licensed and fully bonded) who knows a lot about a lot, Kevin is laser-focused on Acclivity's new product pipeline (i.e. Mobile, Rerun, AccountEdge Cloud). And he's never been seen out of his AccountEdge t-shirt. Never. UPDATE: since the launch of Rerun, and more importantly the advent of the Rerun t-shirt, Kevin has doubled his wardrobe.</p>

                        <p>With a self-imposed 100-word cap, accurately describing Todd’s role may not be possible. Which is why we gave him the ambiguous, yet powerful sounding, title of Product Evangelist. He’s a former accountant, life-long Mac geek and amateur astronomer, who knows as much about our products as he does about Philadelphia sports. He’s also given 1,000,000 product demos (plus or minus). And is it any wonder he’s a product visionary, considering he was born on the same day, same hour as MLK’s “I have a dream…” speech? True story.</p>

                        <p>Jennifer is in charge of breaking things; specifically software. As QA Manager, she works with her team to try any and everything possible to compromise the software. Better it happen here than in your office, is her thinking. And though she can usually be found with her family, when she makes it out of the office, she likes to stay outside. Running, hiking, walking her dog.</p>

Leading a scrappy band of underdogs into battle against the emotionless juggernaut from the communist block (or Mountain View, California). With over two decades of call center experience, Mike’s seen it all. Twice. Aside from heckling customer service organizations in his free time, Mike enjoys watching his (former) hometown Mets and playing video games rated T for Teen. And as out of character as it may seem, Iron Mike is a cat person.</p>

Close, evidently, but no. It’s Cyd. After time spent in a boiler room of an outbound telemarketing company, Cyd appreciates Acclivity’s flexible atmosphere and focus on simply helping customers. Mental note to pick Cyd for the Acclivity Summer Picnic relay race.</p>

An optimist who thinks his biggest achievements are yet to come, Joe's outlook in the Call Center is consistently buoyed by customer compliments. His recipe for success?  Listening, assisting and steering customers on their right course.</p>

She follows a strict schedule, which starts by meeting with David about Milk Bones, and then stopping at pretty much every single person's desk, giving them her best animal shelter stare, and patiently waiting for a handout before moving on. Lunch time she can be found scouring the break room floor for crumbs, followed by an afternoon of serious napping.</p>

                        <p>Lisa has a dual role: helping customers on the phone with their customer service questions and helping to repair damaged or corrupt files. And you know she really is helping when customers are doing things like sending her “thank you” flowers to the office. One of her many reasons for loving Acclivity? The complimentary chair massages during busy season. Mine too.</p>

And while he once had a job killing chickens (it's okay, he hated it), his favorite comfort food is meat loaf. Makes perfect sense. What doesn't make sense is that he's evidently an accomplished singer and dancer and nobody at Acclivity can yet vouch for these skills. Yes, there's the tired "tap dancing is part of his job" line, but seriously, I'd like to see this at the next Acclivity picnic.</p>

The chief marketing force behind Acclivity's awesome recurring billing tool, Melissa is tasked with finding customers, building the brand and growing our social media footprint. Luckily, she managed to get through college with honors while working three jobs, so she's an accomplished multi-tasker. But rest easy. Like every super hero, she has her kryptonite.

And while I could easily make comparisons between the candy factory conveyor belt scene and her role as dutiful Customer Care team member, I won’t. Instead, I’ll focus on her perpetually positive attitude and desire to always find“happy solutions”. Must be her yoga practice and overall zen mindset. Another second-level example of her positivity? She restores old furniture. One woman’s trash is another woman’s treasure and all that.</p>

She currently supervises the Customer Service team, which means she has full reign to make our customers happy at all costs. Not always as easy as it sounds. While you might hear us accusing Donna of living in her own world, it’s likely we’re referring to her penchant for writing fiction in her spare time. And how cool is this: she’s part of a group fighting to have the face of the coal miner on a US postage stamp. You can’t make this stuff up.</p>

Specifically, that means he’s responsible for the administration and care of our computing, networking, web and CRM infrastructure and data. In practical terms, that means there’s usually a line outside his office. Besides Nascar, Georgia Tech football and fashioning a call center in his basement from our old cubicles, Herb actually likes change. You should see the Clark Griswold glimmer in his eye the minute he breaks out his project management software.</p>

From the good people he works with to the team leaders building camaraderie to the opportunity to help customers. But maybe everything’s relative? Maybe it’s all just in comparison to the awful landscaping jobs of days past? Maybe it’s because we don’t force people to eat rye bread (his kryptonite). Whatever it is, we’re glad to have his wit and sensibility on the team. And to think, if his brave Mom didn’t emigrate from Russia so Dan could forge his way in the States... Wait, he’s from Russia and he doesn’t like Rye bread?</p>

She is very grateful when offered a treat and loves to be petted. She is the most popular attendee of the Product Meeting because of her good manners and attentiveness.

Oh, and Sue is a top notch developer who’s been building small business software for well over a decade. Or as she puts it “I’m allowed to play on a computer all day.” Which must fare comparatively well against spending your formative years shoveling six inches of horse manure from a barn. When not tending to her husband, who gets a lot of colds, Sue can be found shopping, hiking or sewing.</p>

                        <p>Ken is a Mac geek who loves developing software, which is good because that’s what he does for a living. That and shuttle his children around like a chauffeur. It’s also rumored that Ken’s annual trek to Apple’s World Wide Developer Conference is a thinly veiled excuse for a week-long sampling of San Francisco’s best Asian cuisine. Maybe I should pull his expense report.</p>

And it’s that eye for detail that makes our stuff look so good. If you like our website, emails or mailers, Justine gets the credit. She is the co-captain of Team Marcom. Aside from fonts, loud music and certain other Marcom team captains (who shall remain nameless), she has a special place in her heart for her dogs/sometimes-office-mascots, Dewey and Duchess, and her latest in a long line of hamsters.</p>

                        <p>Annette is a long-time member of the QA team, thinking and scheming of new ways to break the software. So destructive. Her favorite aspect of Acclivity is the flexibility and “how easy it is to have kids and a career.” Have we mentioned she’s popular? So popular, in fact, she was voted onto the Board of Ed. in her town, by a landslide. All those hours at her kids’ soccer games glad-handing have finally paid off.</p>

Because of Kathy (and the team). See how that works? When not finding bugs, Kathy can be seen in her role as proud mom and driver of a bright yellow Volkswagen bug. Who says she doesn’t take her work home?</p>

If I had a nickel for every time we were in a meeting and the phrase “I don’t know, let’s ask Dave…” was uttered, I’d be a relatively rich man in most third world countries. And what we love about Dave most is that he’s a big-time Jets fan and he loves sushi; two Acclivity-approved endeavors. Also that he brings his industrious little boy to work sometimes to shred documents. Ah, free labor.</p>

While she’s always quick to dabble in the latest technologies, let’s date Anne for a second; she once taught a college class on Fortran. And while she loves the Mac, she once worked for (cue evil music) IBM, but we don’t hold that against her. Most of us, at least.</p>

Her laugh is infectious and can be heard from Green Pond Road on a quiet day. She does everything from the payroll to the bank recs to the milk purchasing, and much like your mom, nobody appreciates what she does until she goes on vacation and they need a plastic spoon. And now that she works from home a couple days a week, rumor has it she actually misses us sometimes.</p>

                        <p>Ryan's self-proclaimed best decision ever? Driving to Ohio to see Tom Waits. I don't have the heart to tell him that our research department has discovered that Tom Waits may have, in fact, been playing closer. But Ryan is never one to take the easy path. For instance, he read Moby Dick, which is a very long (and, one might argue, slow) book. And then there's the parallel to his role on our Customer Care team. A problem-solver by nature, Ryan spends much of his time working on corrupt customer databases. Repairing and returning them to their rightful owners. Sounds way harder than driving to Ohio.</p>

And she takes a lunchtime snooze. Coincidence? Nope. One of the biggest office perks for Cassi, being the animal lover she is, is seeing the Acclivity dogs roaming the halls most Fridays. I bet if the dogs knew she once earned an all-expense paid trip to Disney World because of her Madrigal vocal stylings, they’d be at her feet hoping for a serenade.</p>

Proving, yet again, that you can't judge a book by its cover. Even if said cover is excessively manly, the actual pages might have unexpected emotional depth and sensitivity. You get the picture.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p class="story-text">Some companies are borne on a dollar and a dream. Some are a byproduct of circumstance. Acclivity was built on a little bit of both. With lineage dating back to the late 80s, Acclivity was created in 2005 when two members of MYOB’s management team acquired the US operations. Idea was to service the market locally and pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. And we’ve been busy.
