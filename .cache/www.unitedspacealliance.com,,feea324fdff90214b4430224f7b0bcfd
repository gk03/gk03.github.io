Formed in 1996, it consolidated more than 30 heritage contracts that supported the Space Shuttle Program. Our successes include work on the Space Flight Operations contract (SFOC) and its follow-on, the Space Program Operations Contract (SPOC) as well as the Integrated Mission Operations Contract (IMOC). Under these contracts, USA served as NASA's primary industry partner in human space operations for the day-to-day management of the Space Shuttle fleet, and the planning, training and operations for 55 Space Shuttle missions and more than 35 International Space Station (ISS) increments. Under IMOC, USA supported the long-term use of the ISS, crew and cargo transportation solutions. We are proud of our long, outstanding performance record and history of exceptional customer support.

However, USA will continue to operate in an administrative business capacity to manage government contract close-out requirements. Close-out of government contracts historically takes 5-7 years. The eventual closure of USA necessitates that USA begin reviewing the benefit-related plans it currently administers. At the time that any plan is affected, participants in those plans will be promptly notified. </p>
