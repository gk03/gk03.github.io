<p><strong>Tips To Help Lock Your PC Down From Hackers</strong></p>

<p>Are you afraid of getting hacked? Unsure of what safety measures you can take while using your computer? Worried about keeping your private, personal data secure? We now live in the digital age where everyone is online and we all make purchases and do business online as well. However, despite the convenience and ease of using the Internet, you still run the risk of getting your computer hacked. If your computer, laptop, or smart phone is hacked, the hacker can gain access to your computer history, files, personal information, bank account, credit card information, and much more.</p>

<p><strong>1. Be Wary Of Open Wi-Fi Connections</strong></p>

<p>Anybody can create a wifi hot spot in public. When you access this network unknowingly, your data can be transferred to anybody else on the network. To avoid this, whenever you are in public and want to gain access to an open wifi portal, you should re-confirm the validity of the wifi hot spot with an employee. For example, if you are in Starbucks and want to log into their public wifi, simply verify the exact name of the network with the clerk before logging on.</p>

<p><strong>2. Set Devices To Automatically "Forget" Networks</strong></p>

<p>Next, once you have logged onto the network and you’re finished using it, make sure to disconnect from it. Also, you should set all of your devices to “forget” the network so that your laptop or smartphone doesn’t automatically connect to it the next time you visit. This should be done with all public networks that you use to reduce your risk of getting hacked.</p>

<p><strong>3. Watch Emails Closely</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the above wifi safety tips, you also need to pay close attention to the emails in your inbox. This is especially true when you receive emails from unknown senders that contain an attachment. If you do receive this type of email, make sure that you don’t open the attachment as this usually has a virus or other malicious application that may pose a direct threat to the security of your device.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use Different Passwords And Improve Password Strength</strong></p>

<p>Avoid using the same set of passwords over and over across different sites or online services. If you do, this makes it easier for hackers to gain access to more of your personal data and those passwords are easier to crack. Make sure to change your passwords at least once per month and to use different passwords for all of your online accounts.</p>

<p>In closing, when it comes to your computer safety, it is essential that you follow the above tips to reduce your risk of getting hacked. Of course, these are not foolproof, but following this general set of principles will keep you much safer when using your technology.</p>
