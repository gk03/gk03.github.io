  <div id="rightcolumn">
    <p>Our recruiters use their specialized skills and training to find the best candidates by networking with their associates and acquaintances, talking to managers in the specific industry, contacting candidates they have dealt with in the past, finding hidden talent, luring highly skilled persons from your competitors, searching through internal databases, querying talent communities, and calling former and current consultants for referrals.</p>
    <p>Doing passive recruiting via job postings and searching databases simply will not yield the same results. </p>
