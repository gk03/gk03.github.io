  <div class="SectionHeader"><br>The Future of Automated JCL Management</div> 
  
  <div class="body">JED provides fully automated JCL management for today's z/OS
data centers.&nbsp; JCL validation, JCL standards enforcement, JCL
reformatting, JCL syntax checking, JCL maintenance, conversions and
tuning are now possible, automatically!&nbsp; Robust, yet simple to
use, JED provides a flexible, automated method to address the
labor-intensive tasks associated with the JCL change lifecycle. JED
significantly improves operations and production control environments,
resulting in improved SLAs.&nbsp; JED is destined to become the premier
automated JCL management product on the market.<br>
<br>
JED has been designed to be JCL intelligent.&nbsp; Incorporating JED
into DCMS CCS (Change Control System) or other automated change control
tool permits the management and control of JCL components in the change
lifecycle to be fully automated.&nbsp; JED simplifies JCL management
and quality assurance, resulting in improved productivity and
reliability for the entire Information Technology department.<br>
<br>
JED insures that the JCL entering your production environment is
logically and syntactically error-free and will execute properly.<br>

<a name="Features"></a><div class="SectionHeader">JED Major Features:</div>
<ul>
  <li type="disc" class="body"><strong>JED
JCL validation</strong> - JED automatically validates JCL for logic, syntax and
required structure.&nbsp; User controllable options allow you to tailor
the level of validation, error message issuance and message text.&nbsp;
JED validates JCL based on the processing environment (z/OS and JES
level, security package installed, and tape management tool in use,
etc.) </li>
  <ul>
    <li class="body">Validates JCL coding standards and checks JCL syntax</li>
    <li class="body">Reformats JCL to Information Systems standards </li>
    <li class="body">Insures that all datasets created in production JCL will
      be cataloged </li>
    <li class="body">Checks to insure that each dataset name conforms to installation
      standards </li>
    <li class="body">Insures that each executed program is found in the appropriate
      program load library </li>
    <li class="body">Verifies JCL values such as input/output classes, form names
      and FCB&#8217;s</li>
    <li class="body">Insures that all referenced PDS members exist</li>
    <li class="body">Insures that all referenced GDG base catalog entries exist</li>
    <li class="body">Insures that all existing datasets are cataloged </li>
    <li class="body">Validates SMS values</li></ul><br>
  <li class="body"><strong>IBM Utility Control Statement Validation</strong> -
    Validates the execution PARM and SYSIN control statements for all standard
    IBM utilities including Sort.

    <br>
    <br>
  </li><li class="body"><strong>Reformats IDCAMS Statements</strong> - Reformats
    instream IDCAMS SYSIN statements to installation standards. 

    <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li class="body"><strong>Job Scheduler Interface</strong> - Enables
    Job Scheduler users to view how their scheduler will resolve the
    Job scheduler variables within a jobstream at execution time. <br>
    <br>
  </li><li class="body"><strong>JED Remote Server Facility </strong>- JEDSERV
    enables developers, as well as automated change control systems, working
    from a test LPAR/image, to accurately validate pre-production JCL that will
    later be executed on a different local or remote LPAR/image.
  </li>
</ul>

	
    <ul>
  <li class="body"><strong>JED Online Library Search Facility</strong> - JED
    permits users to concurrently search multiple libraries for combinations
    of  JCL statements containing values that match JCL-specific search criteria.
    Searches are simple to specify and far superior to a simple string search.</li>    
    <ul>
    <li class="body"> For example, you can search for DD statements that specify a BLKSIZE less than 100 and a DDname starting with &ldquo;SYS&rdquo; within a step that executes a program &ldquo;IEBGENER&rdquo;.</li>
    <li class="body">The FIND and CHANGE primary commands also provide a Process-Mode option, enabling background execution.</li>
    <li class="body">The capabilities of the FIND, CHANGE and SEARCH commands can be performed from batch JCL that you can customize and save on your own library.</li>
    <li class="body">This feature is completely JCL intelligent and makes it possible to quickly perform very complex searches without requiring the use of a programming language. </li>
   </ul></ul>
    
    <ul>
      <li class="body"><strong>JED Reporting</strong> - JED
      provides complete analysis and management reporting for all JCL
      components.&nbsp; These reports are an invaluable part of the JCL
      analysis and acceptance lifecycle.&nbsp; The JED reports can be
      selected based on your requirements.&nbsp; This can be as simple as a
      basic JCL listing to a complete cross-reference facility for impact
    analysis during system maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
	
      <ul>
        <li class="body"><strong>JED Installation,
      Configuration and Use </strong>- The learning curve for system administrators
      and users is very short; usage is highly intuitive and
      self-explanatory; extensive online help screens and tutorials are
    available with a single key stroke. </li>
      </ul>
<ul>
      <li class="body"><strong>JED Programming Interface (JPI)</strong> - If
        needed, a site using JED can easily add to the multitude of built-in
        functions by writing a JPI in a non-proprietary language, such as COBOL
        or assembler.&nbsp; JED comes with a number of JPI samples. New or additional
        JPI's can be retrieved from the DCMS Customer Center.  Statements are
        presented to the JPI parsed and in a format that is easy to work with.&nbsp; The
        JPI can manipulate the parsed JCL in many ways:</li>
              <ul class="body">
                <li> Inspect all JCL parameters on all JCL statements</li>
                <li> Add, change or delete any JCL parameter</li>
                <li> Add or delete any JCL step</li>
                <li> Generate error message                </li>
              </ul></ul>

                
        <ul class="body">
          <li> <strong>JED Includes a license for the DCMS Cross-Reference System (XREF)</strong> - XREF is a powerful online cross reference facility that provides complete up-to-the-minute information on program and JCL component relationships. JED XREF allows the user to quickly and accurately 
perform impact analysis reviews showing the effect of updating a particular program or JCL component.  
For example, you can quickly determine such things as which jobs execute a particular program, or which programs access a particular dataset, or which programs use a particular copybook or ++Include module, or which jobs, procs and programs will be impacted if you change a particular dataset. The list of relationships maintained by JED XREF is long and is continuously growing. JED XREF allows analysts to perform error free change impact analysis in seconds rather than hours or days.</li>
<ul class="body"><li>XREF Provides Immediate access to JCL and Program Component Cross

                  <li>XREF is a self maintaining
                    information repository and query system that provides instantaneous
                    access to comprehensive cross reference information on all
                    of your JCL, Proc, and program components. </li>
                  <li>The XREF Monitor
                      keeps the system's database current by updating the database
                      automatically whenever a JCL member or PROC is modified.                      </li>
                  <li> XREF eliminates
                          the need to perform long running and often inaccurate
