Follow us on Twitter at @blacksoftware Tweets. The journey is underway. A new genre of software is being born. As the universe expands, so do software choices for home and school. Corporations marry marketing objectives in their use of ethnic software. blackSoftware has a history. Perhaps the widest distributed blackSoftware product to date is the Encarta Africana CD-ROM released in 1998 on the coattails of its Harvard University affiliated authors, however short-lived it was.<br>
<img src="hh009.jpg" width="74" height="120" alt="blackSoftware character"><br>

blackSoftware contains black culture and black people. People ask us what is it? At first, blackSoftware was made exclusively by American Blacks because they were motivated to create it. Today, any creative thinker or coder can make a blackSoftware product. The Pan African community is ripe for digesting ethnic software.</font></p>

<b><u>GAMES</u></b><br><br>

We have Sungo, an African counting game. to wit: blackSoftware, like black literature, black movies, and black fine art, exists within its own domain. Its is a genre onto it self, although gatekeepers and definers of cultural trends argue that <i>blackSoftware is a NEOLOGISM,</i> but this is not true. It is not true because their knowledge base is informed soley by  their ability to find third party references in a narrow universe of thought when they make comparatives about something new.<br>

<b>Ethnic software</B> is a MASTER category of software including blackSoftware, but it may be Yiddish or Greek software for the Yiddish or Greek community. It may be Brazilian software of Brasil. What makes this software unique? The way the story is told, the characater selections, what the environment looks like, the speaker style, the music, the feeling, the ethnic ID personality already wired into everyone's brain, 
and the soul of the software programs are what makes blackSoftware and ethnic software uniquely what it is.</p><p><font size="+1"><a href="http://blacksoftware.com/wikipediaedit/blackwiki.html" target="_blank" title="the blacksoftware.com definition for ethnic software written for Wikipedia dictionary editors"><u>Share this official definition of Blacksoftware/ethnic software.</u></a></font></p>

After a few seconds, one image appeared,stayed on the screen for seconds, then another clip art image appeared. The slide show was on!  It was time to sit back and watch the images fly by to get a feel for you'll get.<br><br><b>About the Images</B><br><br>I took in the first twenty images, turned and climbed back into this review I'm writing to tell you what I saw so far. The first twenty images were people represented equally by men and women. Not one of the first 20 images of people was younger then 20. Most likely there are clip art images of children on the disc, but I hadn't seen them yet.<br><br>One image sticks out in my head as very memorable. It was the clip art image of a Black woman with a bush of gold colored hair. She could have easily been Hispanic, Latino, African-American, Indian, White, Black Jewish, or mixed. It was a side view of her and the bush was a big as Angela Davis's bush. Now,  the men clip art images were not recognizable men, in my opinion. Its been my experience that people who are shopping for clip art have an idea of what they are looking for and aren't too willing to choose from the vanguard unless their creative work demands it.<br><br>I hear people tell me they don't want cartoonish-looking characters.  People that do are unique in BlackSoftware.com's Black clip art client universe. At least, it has not been the norm for our followers to want a stem-winder of an image. The more the artwork is like a real person from around the neighborhood or across town, the more likely people will want it.  On this disc, the images of men and most women in the first twenty pieces were stemwinders.<br><br> Most of the characters were unusual. I had to stretch my imagination to see how I could use any of these hip-hop type urban clip art images in creative work I'm likely to work with.<br><br>EUREKA! I've discovered a perfect pitch for the stem winders. Consider using them to replace your social media profile pics when you want a change.<br><br>Traditionally, my interest is in print and web image use. I don't think the first batch of clip art images I am viewing relate to hip-hop or hipster culture,  but they try. I think they are relating to the characters you see in a Fat Albert cartoon tv show or in a Flintstones comic book. They don't look like real people - the artist knows that these are visual examples of what he saw or was instructed to draw. I'm looking for images that look like real people in life. Let's keep looking.<br><br>Now, I'm excited!! I've rolled through the next 30 images on the disc. I see some exciting images among them. They appear after the two image panels titled  "mind" and "spirit" as the slide show cntinues. There are at least 6 really good ones in that set and they are equally divided between men and women. <br><br>Take a look at these images:<br><br>- <a href="35.gif" title="Black clip art man"><u>Black man image</u></a><br><br>- <a href="159.gif" title="Black clip art woman image"><u>Black woman image</u></a><br><br>There are more adult images than children on the CD.<br><br>The <i>Urban Clip Art</i> product has 350 images and 10 design templates. Considering the above, we have reviewed the first 60 clip art images of  the 350 total in the product. We are not covering the templates in this review.  We're stopping here on content coverage.  You can explore this product and I'll betcha you'll find items you like.<br><br>For more images, <a href="http://blacksoftware.com/blog/" "title="Black clip art store" target="new"><u>buy the product here.</u></a><br><br>Image Sizes - the Urban Clip Art product images are at least 2,550 pixels wide by 3,330 pixels high. Depending on their orientation they can be larger.<br><br><b>the license agreement</B><br><br>Now, we take a look at wording in the clip art disc license agreement file enclosed. We don't like its software license. There is no reason why anyone who sells content for a creative universe should include limitations on how they intend it to be used. The conflict is - the box cover describes what's in the box and how the software should be used while the license agreement disagrees with the freedom of its intended use.<br><br>Take a look at these parts of the Urban Clip Art package software license where it says:<font size="-1"> <i>you may not use the software on or over a network ...skip. You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the Software or distribute printed copies of any user documentation provided in electronic format.....skip.</i> And it says .. <i>you may not publicly perform or publicly display the Software...</i></font><br><br>Where the license refers to "software," this is not software. Its a collection of files that have certain rights -- but, there is NO programming code in the package at all and <i>software</i> has programming code.  There is no executable SETUP.EXE software installation file in the package.  The publisher fails to consider how the product will be used when they selected the wording for the license they have enclosed.<br><br>This Urban Clip Art product <i>"license agreement"</i>  should consider using a more appropriate license.
