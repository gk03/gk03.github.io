<li>INSTRUMENTS: An administrative measure and/or legal mechanism that establishes a
specific set of land or resource use restrictions.
<li>OBJECTIVES: The intended goal of an IC in minimizing the potential for human
exposure to remaining contamination and/or protecting the integrity of an
engineering control by limiting land or resource use in a particular media.
<li>ENGINEERING: A physical technology implemented to minimize the potential for human
exposure to contamination by means of control or remediation.

of time, for which data may be collected, processed, distributed, or used
for purposes related to ICs.

Land Use Planning, Permit Tracking, Institutional Controls, Facility Siting, and Hazard 
Mitigation where the action is.</font> Analyze what's vulnerable, what's critical, what's been
threatened in the past; what's helping the response, what's helping prevent the danger; what
shows that we're using our dollars wisely and what fits with the other funds being spent.

<h2><p>
<font color="#3300FF"><font size="5">Why CEtech? CEtechnology's Unique Community Vision:</font>
</font></h2> Towns, Campuses, School Districts, and Military Bases have evolved with concerns
common to many small cities with their increasing complexity of land use, infrastructure,
transportation, environmental health and safety, technology, and the provision of services.
<p>
Cetechnology planning guides and databases can help you address these issues while extending
your reach locally, regionally, even worldwide through the internet. Above all else they make
communities (people and property) safer via state-of-the art Risk Management!
<ul>
<li>We know Local Government! Our Institutional Controls, Land Use Master Plan Template and
Software serves as a planning standard to help guide economic, environmental, emergency
management, and technology growth within your community.
<p>
<li>Our School District and Higher Education Guides and Software backstop administrative and
academic decision making processes. Our clients include colleges and universities as well as
urban and suburban school districts big and small.
<p>
<li>We extend local government planning concepts to military base redevelopment. Our Land Use
Master Plan Guide (MS Word) and Software helps them make the necessary adjustments to address
base closures, new construction, or a move into the new economy.
