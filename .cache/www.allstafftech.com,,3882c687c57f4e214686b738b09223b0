			<h2>Who we are?</h2>
			<p>AllStaff Technical Solutions' parent company began business in 1991.  In 2009, due to rapid growth of our Government Technical Division, AllStaff Technical Solutions, Inc. was spun off as a stand-alone company providing technical consulting services to Federal Government Contractors.   As a <a href="certification.pdf">WBENC certified</a> Woman Owned Small Business, our key differentiators results from the fact that our division is staffed by employees with a hands-on technical background. This experience allows us to identify individuals who not only meet your written requirements, but also have the subtle qualities that enable an employee to excel in their position. </p>

			<h2>What we do?</h2>
			<p>Maintaining a robust enterprise environment includes being a master of disparate systems, creating new applications and integrating these new solutions back into the environment. We can help you tackle small problems requiring one or two consultants or can broaden our efforts to undertake your biggest technical challenges.</p><p>We generally provide support in three areas: Infrastructure Support, Application Development, and Program Support.   This support is usually provided to our clients in one of three ways, Technical Solutions, Subcontracting Solutions, and Staffing Solutions.

			<h2>Where we support?</h2>
			<p>We have found that the synergy gained when our clients do what they do best (acquiring work) and we do what we do best (finding talent) results in extreme success. As such, our technical solutions have been in support of clients working for Federal Civilian Agencies, the Department of Defense, Intelligence Agencies, and State and Local Government.</p><p>Our clients include, but are not limited to, large businesses such as Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, HP, Booz Allen Hamilton, IBM, and Verizon.</p>
