Welcome to Controlblue! <p>

Controlblue is a Crestron system design and programming firm. We are a member of Crestron’s CSP  program--> <a href="http://www.crestron.com/contact/find-crestron-services-providers-programmers-locator">Crestron CSP</a> 
<p>

We offer services to automation, audio/video, and lighting control system dealers and contractors in both commercial and residential applications. </p> 

<p>
Controlblue was created in 2008 in Orlando, Florida by Josh Patton. Josh is a Certified Crestron Programmer.

Josh has been in the audio/video industry since 1997 and has programmed and completed hundreds of control systems including Crestron, AMX, Lutron, Elan, Centralite, and various programmable universal remote controls.

Josh’s interests in audio/video, computer programming, and graphic design led him to control and automation systems. These interests have helped to create not only functional, easy to use systems, but also clean, intuitive user interfaces and custom instruction manuals for clients.

His expertise and ability in programming and system design have helped him successfully complete multiple projects in residential, corporate, government and university locations all over the United States.

Controlblue is intentionally small, with no aspirations to become a large, impersonal programming firm. This industry requires personal attention and expertise that come from direct interaction between the client and programmer as well as quick turnaround times.

With Controlblue, the attention of an experienced programmer and designer is focused on your project throughout its entirety. <p>

Controlblue was forged in the fires of 1998 on a chance meeting at a grocery store in Dr Phillips, Florida between
