        <ul class="cd-testimonials">
          <li>
            <p> Debbi is a highly professional technical writer that is a joy to work with.  Her amazing communication and coordination skills have been invaluable in collaborating with a varied team of cross-functional members to develop accurate and effective documentation for the varying audiences of our user groups. </p>
            <div class="cd-author">

            <p> Debbi is a top-notch technical writer who is clearly a master of her craft. She brings a level of "been there, done that" that would be of comfort to anyone releasing technical documents for a new product or service in the tech industry. Debbi is able to put together accurate timelines for delivery, communicates and collaborates well with all stakeholders and contributors throughout the project. Most importantly, Debbi is skilled at combining an understanding of the underlying technology of the product she is documenting with a good business-level understanding of her clients' needs to deliver quality publications that meet expectations. I would happily recommend Debbi's services and would certainly hire her for future documentation projects. </p>
