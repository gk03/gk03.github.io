<h2>Modernize</h2>

<p>PET technology can revolutionize how we live today.&nbsp; No more lines at  
the supermarket.&nbsp; Simply walk through the scanner at the express line door  
and all your groceries will be totaled and deducted from your PET smart card in  
your wallet or purse.&nbsp; Tired of being uncomfortable when you sit, also  
known as &quot;thick wallet&quot; syndrome?&nbsp; Reduce its size by one-third  
with PET's super thin design.&nbsp; Drivers' licenses and credit cards will  
never crack or break again because PET is more flexible and durable than thick  
PVC cards used today.&nbsp; Make your business card stand out among the  
rest.&nbsp; Add full color photos, holograms, foil, and more!</p>  

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Everyone is, or should be, concerned about security.&nbsp; Make your company  
or school ID a secure pass.&nbsp; Magnetic stripes, barcodes, IC chips, and  
proximity cards are all available at SEI.&nbsp; Use it for multiple  
applications at the same time.&nbsp; Make it an ID card, bus pass, time card,  
company discount card, security access to employee only areas, and debit card  
all-in-one.&nbsp; This is only the beginning.&nbsp; Gift certificates, customer  
appreciation programs, loyalty systems that print transactions on the card each  
time you use it, and other multi-application programs are available.&nbsp; SEI <em>is</em>  
the answer to all of your card needs.</p>  

<h2>System Solution</h2>

<p>Optimizing your business does not have to be a challenging conquest; nor should  
it be expensive.&nbsp; At SEI, our goal is to provide your business with a  
cost-effective, tailored tool that specifically meets your demands.&nbsp; SEI&#146;s  
innovative products and exceptional service will assist your business in being  
equipped for success.</p>  

<h2>Recent Expansion</h2>

<p>SEI continues to expand its market of new and different technologies.&nbsp; Our  
new electronic music stand allows the musician to load their favorite music  
piece into the stand.&nbsp; By just pressing a foot pedal connected to the stand, the  
music is updated.&nbsp; The musician can play flowingly without ever having to stop  
and turn the page.&nbsp; Also our new crystal art photographs add a delicate touch to  
our inventory.&nbsp; These etched photographs are beautifully detailed to give your  
photos a crystal clear image.&nbsp; Check out this new merchandise at <a href="newprod.html"><em>New products</em></a>.</p>
