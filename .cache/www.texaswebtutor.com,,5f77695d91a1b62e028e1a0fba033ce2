		<p>You love music and you know it is a gift. You may be one of those fortunate souls who had the opportunity to learn to play music. Or you may never had a chance to learn. Either way, you know how music stirs the emotions and you know how the mathematical side of the music engages the brain in ways that are hard to match. Scientists call this <a title="Cognitive_neuroscience_of_music" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive neuroscience of music" target="_blank">cognitive neuroscience of music</a>.</p>
<p>You want your child to learn. But where do you start?</p>
<p>Actually, the question is,  &#8220;where do you want to end&#8221;?</p>
<p>Your child has a lot of energy and is experimenting. A month ago stormy Johnny wanted to be a astronaut, a week ago he loved soccer and now he is into playing Jazz. It is hard enough to keep up with them physically and now you have to find a way to guide them mentally and emotionally without hearing those dreaded words as a teenager, “Mom, you never listen to me!”</p>
<p>May be not those exact words, but something similar. You remember! You used the similar words when you were a teenager.</p>
<p>And that is the point of starting with your goal.</p>
<p>Do you want to find something to fill  Johnny’s time so that you can have some peace and quiet. Or do you want Angelina to experience something that will help her through life?</p>
<p>You have the experience, you have been there. You and stormy Johnny and curious Angelina are not that different. Your approach to life may be, but your core needs of love, care, acknowledgment and the freedom of expression are not.</p>
<p>Music is an inter-generational bridge sometimes built on discord. Recognizing that fact itself is a musical lesson. Not all musical pieces are harmonious. That would be to boring. The conflict adds the drama in music and life. It makes life interesting.</p>
<p>Teaching music to children is teaching them about life. If you remember that, you would have easier time to detach yourself from a specific short term situation which is similar to a musical phrase and focus on the entire composition which builds lives and relationships.</p>
<p>You can find lessons in classical music for children in violin as well as recognizing the beauty of learning to play acoustical guitar with its rich Spanish heritage is as powerful.</p>
<p>What is it that you want to accomplish goes hand in hand with what are the weaknesses and strengths of stormy Johnny and curious Angelina.</p>
<p>Just like you, they much rather use their strengths and avoid situations that reveals their weakness. You can help them use those strengths and shore up their weaknesses.</p>
<p>How to <a href="http://www.guitarresources.net/chords-lesson/" target="_blank">learn guitar chords</a> or leaning music theory without improving relationships will not last long and go far enough.</p>
<p>You remain the most valuable resource in teaching music to children. Once you understand that, you can then find and instructor who can help you.</p>

<p>With business globalization speaking English, is becoming increasingly important to have a clear communication and language that still brings many countries together.</p>
<p>English is not even close to most widely spoken language in the world. However, it still acts as a unifying factor.</p>
<p>With increasing availability of technology over the Internet, it has become easier than ever to learn online. Even those who have access to an English teacher can benefit from the blended learning which mixes personal instructions with online learning.</p>
<p>You can watch videos, practice conversation, complete games that enhance your use of English language without relying so much in textbooks may not help your conversational English.</p>
<p>There are several online English schools you can choose from. Here are a few tips of what to look for as you compare them.</p>
<p>There is no such a thing as best English online classes. The best for one person may not work as well for another. Grammar may be important the person who relies heavily on writing, but not necessarily as important to a person who needs to communicate through conversation.</p>
<p>Some students learn better through visual aids and for others auditory tools is more effective.</p>
<p>Not much vocabulary is needed for daily communication. However, mastering the pronunciation of technical terms related to your profession may be critical to effective communication in your job or business.</p>
<p>It always helps for you to list what it is that you are trying to accomplish and the requirements for that. That list helps you find quality instructions that meets your objectives.</p>
<p>From a teacher’s point of view, quality of instruction includes instructor&#8217;s preparation as well as the material is used in each lesson.</p>
<p>A native English speaker may not need to prepare how to speak, but they still need to prepare the class agenda so the students can learn well and organize the material in a way that is most effective in teaching. In other words, an English speaking person may not be an English teacher.</p>
<p>Always ask about the background of the person who’s teaching and if they have formal training and education in general and English specifically (<a href="http://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/bachelor-arts-english">1</a>).</p>
<p>Check out the syllabus and see if it covers your needs and review the teaching modalities.</p>
<p>Always remember that speaking English is a skill. To get better, you need to practice. You need to practice writing is writing is important to you. Texting and tweeting don&#8217;t count unless you want to be a social media communicator. The writing articles that use full sentences specially in your profession helps.</p>
<p>If the conversation is important to you, then you need to practice talking. Talk to your colleagues who do speak English, in English. Even though their native language is different. One of the pitfalls in improving conversational English is when you speak their native language most of the time and only English occasionally.</p>
<p>I remember when I started, most of my family could speak English, but there are comfortable with my native language. I had to make an effort to to let them know it helps me if they speak English so that I can practice. They’re all very understanding and helpful. People like that most of the time. Asked him for help and don’t give it to you.</p>
