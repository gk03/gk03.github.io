            <h1>Discover IT business solutions for real business problems.</h1>

                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At MauleTechnologies, we  provide efficient and cost effective  business technology solutions for our clients. These solutions optimize  our client's technology investments and allow  them to focus on their core business. MauleTechnologies has earned a  reputation for consistently delivering sound  solutions, quality service and support, on time and on  budget. Our process for technology discovery, design, implementation  and  maintenance has enabled our long term success.<br />
                  <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every small to medium sized business (SMB) experiences a point where it needs ongoing IT and database support, but doesn't have the financial resources for a full time person. MauleTechnologies is the solution.<BR />
  <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide the technical support required so you can focus on your business. We   provide a complete outsourced IT subscription model that allows SMBs to have all of the attributes of an in-house IT  department. We provide server, workstation, network and database deployment, upgrades and support, backup service, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) all with the benefit of reduced  operating costs.<br />
                <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether you require 1 hour a month or 80, we provide a plan that works for you and your budget. Our  broad expertise in LAN, WAN, WIFI networks, servers, workstations, database management, and  business applications will enable your information technology to enhance your business processes rather than get in its way.<br />
                  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MauleTechnologies specializes in technology solutions for SMB's through  business process investigation, custom software design and database  integration. Do you have a &quot;One size fits all&quot; corporate or enterprise  software solution that meets &quot;most&quot; of your but not all? We can help! Tap into our diverse backround in  customizing your  technologies to take you business to the next level.<br /> 
<BR />  

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have affinity for non profit groups in and around the state. We recognize that non-profits have limited resources and budgets. Often the staff or friends of the organization with the most technical experience become the default IT person and sometimes this leads to an eclectic collage of various computers and network components. It is important to take a step back and evaluate how much of your organization's time and resources are spent supporting donated and malfunctioning servers, workstation and networks. If this sounds like you, we can improve your existing infrastructure, recommend updates, train you to support your own technology, and always be just a phone call away when things get over your head.
