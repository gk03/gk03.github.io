                        We accomplish all this with the <b>Four Pillars</b> of our software.
                    </p><h2 class="FourPillars FourPillarsSummary" id="FourPillarsGraphicsHeading">
                        Pillar 1 - Graphics
                    </h2><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsSummary" id="FourPillarsGraphicsSummary">
                        We combine photos from your inventory with graphics and text from your dealership and your salesperson, along with your message to
                        generate exciting, colorful, impactful images that tell your story to your customers in a way that gets their attention and brings
                        them to your showroom. <span class="FourPillarsClickable" onclick="ShowFourPillars(this, 'FourPillarsGraphics')">Show more...</span></p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" id="FourPillarsGraphics1">
                        The first step is to upload images representing your dealership – such as a Dealership Banner and Logo.  We also provide for other
                        standard images relating to the dealership.  In addition, for each salesperson you set up in the system, we provide for uploading a
                        Salesperson Photo.  These go a long way to generating customer connection when included in an advertisement.

                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" ide="FourPillarsGraphics2">
                        The second step is to link to your inventory provider so we may import your inventory on a daily basis.  We use the photos you uploaded,
                        along with the details about a vehicle and merge that information into a series of images.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" ide="FourPillarsGraphics3">
                        The next step is to upload graphics you may want to include in an image – for example a red tag, or a flag or any other graphic you
                        might imagine.  We have a series of stock images that are included in the system for anyone to use as well and we keep expanding the
                        selection to include holiday specific images (fireworks for the 4th of July, American flags for Memorial Day, etc.).
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" ide="FourPillarsGraphics4">
                        Finally, we create templates – or you create templates – that merge all these images and graphics together, along with information
                        about the vehicle being advertised, the dealership (IE name, address, and phone) and any other text you want to include.  Templates
                        can be designed for a user to fill in all the blanks or to create posts automatically with no intervention at all.  The choice is
                        always yours!
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" ide="FourPillarsGraphics5">
                        When a user uses our system to manually create a post, they can add additional graphics on the fly – called Stamps – that emphasize
                        a message specific to the vehicle advertised.  For example, we have "Certified Pre Owned" stamps that may be used on certified vehicles.
                        Or perhaps a "One Owner" stamp to promote a high quality pre-owned vehicle.  We have uploaded a whole series of stamps to the system
                        already, but you can also add your own stamps as you need them.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsGraphics" ide="FourPillarsGraphics6">
                        You may also create templates that allow the user to upload custom photos.  These are great when creating a template for posting to
                        your Facebook™ page – where you may want to tell the story of another satisfied customer along with a photo of the new customer and their vehicle.

                        Pillar 2 - Intelligent Automation
                    </h2><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsSummary" id="FourPillarsAutomationSummary">
                        We provide tools to automate the process of posting advertisements on various ecommerce sites in a way that allows you to determine
                        which selection of vehicles is posted exactly when you want it to be posted – maximizing the effectiveness of your advertising spend.
                        <span class="FourPillarsClickable" onclick="ShowFourPillars(this, 'FourPillarsAutomation')">Show more...</span></p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsAutomation" id="FourPillarsAutomation1">
                        Once you have all these wonderful templates prepared for posting beautiful images and messages, the next challenge is getting your sales
                        staff to use the product and actually post!  Some dealerships using our system like the manual process.  Their BDC manager watches
                        the phones and when the ringing slows down, they tell their staff to start posting.  Calls come in, they ease off posting for a while.
                        Other dealerships prefer to set up automation.  Our Intelligent Automation does more than just dump your inventory onto a web site.
                        We let you configure the system to post the right vehicles at the right time with the right frequency to maximize impact.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsAutomation" id="FourPillarsAutomation2">
                        The first step in setting up Intelligent Automation is to set up a Selection.  Here, you tell the system what criteria to use to select a
                        vehicle – or a group of vehicles.  This criteria is based on the data we can import from your inventory – such as Year, Make, Model, Color,
                        Certified (yes or no), New or Used, Price Range, time in inventory, etc.  You can set up as many selections as you want.  For example,
                        you can set up a selection for all Certified Pre Owned vehicles of a certain make, or you can set up selections for vehicles that are fresh
                        in inventory, or one for those that have been in inventory too long.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsAutomation" id="FourPillarsAutomation3">
                        Once you set up a selection, you set up Campaigns for that selection.  A campaign defines the frequency and quantity of posts for that selection.
                        When posting to a site such as Craigslist™, you may want to match a Certified Pre Owned selection with a campaign that posts 5 ads a day on
                        Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, one per hour from 9AM to 3PM and another campaign that posts 10 ads a day on Thursday, Friday and Saturday,
                        one every half hour.  You may set up as many campaigns for each selection as you want.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsAutomation" id="FourPillarsAutomation4">
                        Once you set up the frequency for a Campaign, you next select which templates should be used for that Campaign.  For example, you can match the
                        Certified Pre Owned selector with templates that have a CPO logo on them.  You may match a selector of vehicles fresh in inventory with templates
                        that emphasize New Arrivals – or a selector of vehicles that have been in inventory too long with a template that emphasizes Manager Specials.
                        Each campaign may be matched up with any number of templates.  The system will randomly select from the list of templates assigned for each post.

                        With sites like Autotrader.com, Cars.com and Cargurus.com, we use a "Post Until Sold" method.  For example, if you contract with these sites to
                        post 100 featured vehicles, you can set up a selector for a particular make of vehicle.  Match this with a campaign that allows for posting 20 of
                        those vehicles.  Create some other selectors and match them with campaigns that fill up your quota of 100 vehicles.  We will create the images and
                        post them for you.  As a vehicle falls off your inventory, we will replace that ad with another one that comes from the same selector as the
                        vehicle that was sold.  Until the vehicle falls off inventory, we will continue to post it to these sites.

                        Pillar 3 - Control
                    </h2><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsSummary" id="FourPillarsControlSummary">
                        We provide the tools so you can control who posts what, when and how often, thus protecting your advertising budget so that it is used to
                        its maximum potential. <span class="FourPillarsClickable" onclick="ShowFourPillars(this, 'FourPillarsControl')">Show more...</span></p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsControl" id="FourPillarsControl1">
                        One thing we discovered in the early days of our system was that some salespeople like our system too much!  We had a situation where a salesperson
                        used up over half the monthly budget for posting to Craigslist in two days.  We quickly added controls in the system, enhancing them over time as we
                        observed patterns of use.  Now, you can configure each salesperson with a limit on how many ads they may post to each site.  You can set these limits
                        for specific days of the week, an entire week or month.  You can also set goals for each day so your salespeople know what is expected.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsControl" id="FourPillarsControl2">
                        In addition to setting limits on each salesperson, you can set the same limits for the entire dealership.  You may have five salespeople using the
                        system, configured to allow them to post 20 ads on Wednesdays – but you can limit this further by configuring the dealership to only allow 70 ads
                        on Wednesday.  This way, if one salesperson is off that day, you don’t underperform your goals.
                    </p><p class="FourPillars FourPillarsControl" id="FourPillarsControl3">
                        On top of our limits, you also have control of suspending the ability to post to a site temporarily – thus preventing anyone from posting to that site.
