		<p> Qortex is an extremely efficient and effective way of communicating within a team. While email is direct and clear, time is often lost as there are no team oriented services to my knowledge that can organize team communication as effectively as Qortex.</p>
		<p> I especially liked the To-Dos and acknowledgement features: I can’t even begin to illustrate how completely frustrating it was to keep track of team tasks without Qortex. Line, Facebook or Email simply don’t cut it. Qortex is the ultimate team communication online experience.</p>
